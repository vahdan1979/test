Asian Fusion,85 Bedok North Fried Oyster,1,"Once or if we're lucky, twice every year we get to fly to the Food Paradise that is Singapore. This is one of our ""go to"" food centres when we're in Singapore.Usually the tell-tale sign of a good dish or chef is the lines out the front but I think some people just enjoy lining up for food at times in Singapore without their being any substance behind the food for my tastes.Another gauge is that there's photos of celebrities, certificate of awards and merit and newspaper clippings adorning the stalls sign or posted at every convenience but it seems to be becoming more and more popular amongst stalls and not always a denominator of quality and this was one of those places that didn't have any such advertisements but the quality was definitely there.Char Kway Teow is a wok fried dish and usually is served with some sort of seafood and can vary from having an array of prawns, to squid and cockles (a type of shell fish) with flat rice noodles which are all cooked at an extremely high heat. The skill of the chef is always evident in how they can infuse the ""Wok Hei"" aka wok's breath or flavour of the wok into their fare and balance that with all the other flavours going on in a very complex flavoured dish.The flavours balanced very well and the Wok Hei was more prominent than most hawkers, it was beautifully crafted and as much as the Wok Hei is important to the overall flavour of the dish, the little bits of pork lard are a signature too and an absolute must which there was plenty of. If you like it a little spicy, ask for chilli when ordering.We also always order their Oluak aka Oyster Omelette which has a mix of just cooked oysters in a omelette with garlic and chives which is dipped in chilli sauce. Although I do enjoy the version of Oluak here, there is a place that does it with an extremely crispy finish, that's hard to go past. We never miss ordering it though, as I'm a sucker for a good Oluak and it goes great with the Kway Teow.It may take a little time to fine a seat at the Bedok Block 85 North complex where the food hall is situated but there is plenty to choose from whilst there and it's worth the wait. The chicken wings from the store next door are good, as is the two stalls around the corner that sit side by side to each other that serve Bak Chor Mee aka pork noodles. Just check out my other posts at Bedok Block 85 North for more information on the food available in the same complex.Overall I think it was an excellent example of Char Kway Teow and it's getting more and more difficult to find really good ones in Singapore. For me if it hasn't got Wok Hei, it makes the difference between good and impressive and on this occasion there was plenty to wrap my mouth around and we will definitely be back.Cheers!Dave."
Asian Fusion,Akira Back,1,"2nd time back and really enjoyed the food. Think Japanese, Korean, & Mexican. Put them all together and you get the unique flavors of Akira Back. We were a group of 10 and did not know how much to order so we asked the staff to plan a dinner for 10.  Next thing we know, food kept pouring out of the kitchen, from tacos to sashimi to rib eyes and sous vide chicken breast and finished off with signature rolls. It was way too much for us. I recommend, if you want to do what we did, to reduce the head count. So for a group of 10, I would plan for 7 or 8. That way there's room for desserts. Make sure to include the pork belly roll and you can skip the fried rice. I was too busy eating to take photos of these dishes. All of them are visually tasty too. Fantastic staff. Very nice and accommodating. Knowledgeable too.For a special night, I highly recommend Akira Back."
Asian Fusion,Akira Back,1,"Excellent appetizers, rolls and miso soups. Must try the spicy crab miso soup, the brother from another mother roll and tuna tacos.Didn't take pics as I was hungry, but will during next next visit.Staff is wonderful and friendly. Perfect for couples, groups, customers and friends..."
Asian Fusion,Akira Back,1,"Have been waiting to write my review for this restaurant but was dismay to find this restaurant has not been listed back then. For good reasons if it helps in controlling the crowd for this restaurant (since I assume not that many people are aware of this place) because W O W, what a great great restaurant to dine and wine at on a chilled night. We were a group of 4 and started the night off with the mushroom pizza served with Ponzu Mayo and truffle oil. SO SO GOOD I could eat the whole damn pizza. Only had 2 pieces sadly. Continued with the Miso Black cod, Brother from another Mother maki roll and both the Wagyu and king crab fried rice. Each dish was tastefully done and had some great element about them. It's one of those dishes where you would think, wow I don't mind having a second portion of this because it is addictive. Located at JW Marriott , the restaurant's ambience was 5 stars worthy needless to say. I felt pampered throughout and would love to head back to the restaurant again just for a nice romantic date."
Asian Fusion,Akira Back,1,Amazing sushi and great sake.....and the service was excellent. The restaurant is on the ground floor of the new JW Marriott South Beach in downtown Singapore....highly recommended....
Asian Fusion,Alma,1,"This is one of my favorite restaurants. I have had many fond memories, special events. Since winning a Michelin star, their food continues to improve. In terms of variety, quality, creativity and presentation, Alma is in the same league as other great restaurants. What makes Alma stand out are it's flavors. Exec Chef Johari and his Chef de Cuisine Zaini, Singaporeans lend unique flavors to their dishes. Every bite is an adventure. Front of the house is helmed by long term Manager and Sommeller Saravana who makes sure the service is impeccable. Nothing is too difficult and if you need something special, they will move mountains to get it done. Price wise, it's in the upper end, but considering it's a Michelin star restaurant, frankly a bargain. If you don't want to burn a hole in your wallet, consider heading there for lunch. At under $40 per person for a 3 course meal, you can sample chef's artistry in the cheap, though I warn you that you will likely go for the full monte dinner 6 or 8 course menu at a later date. Highly recommended restaurant, they change their menu every 4 months or so, so you shouldn't be bored."
Asian Fusion,Alma,1,"So I booked Alma because 1) it's highly recommended as a 1 star michelin 2) ideal location on Orchard Rd and walking distance from the Marriott where we were staying and 3) duh - it's my name! ;)Upon first arrival we were a smidge concerned as we were the only people in the restaurant at 7:30pm. However, after a few minutes of being warmly welcomed by the staff my friend & I knew we had made a good decision. The food further cinched that notion as our meal was absolutely delicious. We did the 5 course tasting menu with the wine pairing, and every dish that came out was more delicious than the prior one. Two of the standout dishes for me were the crispy pork belly with mustard and kale (cooked perfectly crispy) and the chilled angel hair past with seaweed and lobster.  The wines were also perfectly suited for each dish and the pours were very generous, although admittedly the sommelier didn't always pour the paired wine when we got each dish - not a huge deal. The restaurant did fill up as the evening progressed yet we were happy to see the service remained very attentive even so. All in all, we were very impressed with Alma and both felt it may be under-rated as a one star. My friend & I have both been to many michelins restaurants and IMHO our experience was closer to a two at least. Definitely worth a visit folks! :)"
Chinese,Balestier Road Hoover Rojak,1,"How literal can a dish get? Rojak, which means mixture in Bahasa Melayu, is a salad of sliced apples, cucumbers, turnips, fresh-from-the-grill deep-fried you tiao (fried dough fritters) and crispy tau pok (bean curd puffs), tossed in a stone bowl with that sweet-tangy-salty sauce (and chilli, if you like!) made with lotus flowers and cuttlefish, sprinkled with crushed peanuts and sugar to seal the deal. There are plenty places to get a good Rojak, but Hoover brings it to the next level with the best sauces and the crispest, freshest ingredients."
Chinese,Balestier Road Hoover Rojak,1,"My first Rojak - a mix of vegetables, dough and fruit chunks in a sweet peanut sauce. This was rich, delicious and a fantastic pair with the saltier duck rice next door. Be prepared for a wait (20~ minutes at 1pm on a Saturday.)"
Chinese,Balestier Road Hoover Rojak,-1,"Well, it's too bad the old man has retired. It's just not the same anymore. It's no longer the die die must eat rojak. Sigh!"
Chinese,Balestier Road Hoover Rojak,-1,"I like it for its liberal and generous dousing of sweet prawn paste sauce and crushed peanuts, making it a wet rojak. If you love the sauce, you will want to scoop up all the sauce and end the meal on a sweet note. It is that sweet.The assortment of fruits and veggies are in pretty big pieces, so it is quite easy to stab one with the stick provided and get a satisfying bite. I do prefer the fried dough stick (you tiao) to be crispier. The version is a bit soft here. But it is still good.You could also ask for chili to be on the side, if you are sharing with those who do not take spicy food. Personally I prefer the chili to be mixed in.You will not miss this stall, which faces the car park, and often has a line of people waiting to be served. Yelp Feb 2014 Challenge: 21/28"
Chinese,Balestier Road Hoover Rojak,-1,"Not quite sure if it's really THE BEST ROJAK in Singapore, because I definitely prefer the one at Old Changi Airport Hawker Centre!Well, I guess they just taste different I guess. Hoover Rojak is more of 'sweet' and 'wet', while I prefer the you tiao and tau pok to be more toasted before it gets mixed in... so well, it's all about preferences!"
Chinese,Balestier Road Hoover Rojak,1,"Rojak is usually best eaten fresh and on the spot, but the one my colleagues dabao for me was really good. I generally don't go to Whampoa Market to eat even though its very near my office because parking is a hassle so it's really thanks to my colleagues that I found a good rojak place they can help me dabao from.There's a very good flavour overall and there are more ingredients than most places and the chunks of fruit in it are thick wedges, not thin slices."
Chinese,Balestier Road Hoover Rojak,1,"If Chow Yun Fatt eats here, that's good enough for me. It's the best rojak because they do not stinge on using good ingredients. I like the prawn paste here because it is less salty compared to others, and the yu tiao is fresh and crunchy. You rarely find freshly sliced ginger flowers used for fragrance in rojak anymore.   All this all together and you end up with rojak that has plenty of crunch, taste and flavour! One way to get all the yummy goodness is to use the beansprouts to soak and scoop up the last bits of sauce for the best satisfaction."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Yum yum and yum. Burnt ends was a fabulous meal in Singapore!We tried making reservations starting a month out, and everything was booked. We were bummmed, but figured we would still give it a shot when we were in town. We were able to walk right in with no wait! We were seated at the high top tables, but if we had chosen to wait an hour we could have had regular seating as well. If you are in town without reservations, I would still give it a shot bc it was so worth it! If you have a choice, go with the table top seating.....you can watch the magic happen. Cocktails were phenomenal (one has burnt sage on top-super fragrant), and we really loved the small plates and sharable plates. The Jacobs Ladder (meat from between the ribs) was fatty and delicious, and had a great mustard sauce. The jerk chicken with the citrus cream sauce was also fabulous. The pulled pork sandwich was huge and had a ton of flavor. The king crab with brown butter was a delicious main course, decent amount of crab and the butter sauce also had capers (yum!). We are so glad we took a shot and were able to walk in and experience this place on our one night in Singapore."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,-1,"This is one of the most disappointing experiences I've had in Singapore as well as dining at the Worlds's Top 50. When your reservation (that you make 3 months in advance) says ""bar seating"" what they really mean is wall seating. Your seat is an uncomfortable bar stool at an iron grate shelf facing a wall. When we asked if there was any other options the hostess rudely stated that was what our reservations were made for. Fine. Seat us then. Our cocktails were weak and when we asked for a dirty martini, we were told they only brine they had in the restaurant was jalapeño brine. We tried several starters, Grissinni (simple and tasty), Jerk chicken (pass - it was a super fatty piece of chicken smeared in mayo) and the Beef Marmalade (which was the best dish we sampled). The Marmalade was delicious. We also tried the Sanger sandwich (while good, it was missing an element of flavor). Maybe some spice could highlight the flavors? And last we were recommended to try the venison. Unfortunately the venison was brought out with little actual meat and instead a huge bone that apparently accounted for the majority of the weight that we paid for. I expect more at this price point and for the hype. What a huge disappointment. Save your money and get some actual quality food elsewhere. I would have preferred roasted meat from a Hawker stall."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Wow wow. 10/10. Amazing. Phenomenal. Delicious. Mouth watering. An experience you can't miss. If you don't go, you messed up"
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Very nice Australian Cuisine. Booking is essential. We booked 3 months ahead and managed to only get a ""bar seat"". That means you sit facing the blank wall on a bar stool, not the best for a social outing.The food was good and so was the service. I found it a bit rich. We started off with the Quails egg & caviar, followed by Grissini & Taramasalata. Both good. The Beef Marmalade and Leek, Hazelnut & Truffle were also good. I found the Pulled Pork Burger ordinary. The King Crab and Garlic Brown butter was excellent but rich. The final dish of Onglet was also nice.Over all it was a nice meal although most uncomfortable on a bar stool."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,Dinner Tip: Go line up a little bit before they open at 6p. Spots are gone in 15 minutes! Put your name down and come back when they call you.
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"The restaurant was tiny in size with about 19 counter seat, 6 bar seats, and chef table which could seat 8. The day before I checked its website, and was able to make a reservation for its counter seat. As I was one of its first customers of the day, I was able to get the first seat next to the cashier, with a great view of the open kitchen. Smoked Quail Egg and Caviar ($12+)Gone in a mouthful, it was an exciting moment in the mouth, although one could not help feeling that it was quite expensive for an egg.Duck Hearts and Peri Peri ($8+)I was not quite a fan of duck hearts and expecting it to be quite spicy, but it tasted chewy with a hint of spices.Beef Marmalade and Pickles ($14+)Very nice with the freshly cooked marmalade on the toast, but a tab messy to eat.Burnt Ends' Sanger ($20+)Pulled Pork Shoulder, Cole Slaw, Chipotle Aioli, Brioche BunI had this takeaway after looking at most other customers having it. It was huge and packs lots of meat in it with lots of flavours in it. Almost could not finished it.Onglet, Burnt Onion and Bone Marrow ($32.10+)I like that the steak was served sliced which made it easy to eat with a fork. I was not a fan of bone marrow due to its gel like appearance but it tasted great with the meat.Berry Tart ($12+)It was the dessert item of the day. Served with chantilly cream, although I wish there was vanilla ice cream to go with it. Looked simple, it tasted quite good without too tart. I like the part just before the crust which gave a kind of chewy bite.Overall food was great. Although the counter seats were full, the place was not too noisy and just nice for a meal."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Even though I've heard so much about this restaurants, it took me almost a year before my husband chanced upon it while looking for late night supper. We were greeted by servers with a strong Australian accent, ""Howdy mate"", and saw that the restaurant was still packed at 11pm. We managed to get the last two seats at the counter (basically the entire restaurant are counter seats) and was told that only the pulled pork burger was available as their restaurant was closed. So that saved us from making choices. My husband then asked if they had fries since I wanted some with my burger. Sadly the kitchen was closing so they didn't have any but we got the beef marmalade instead. In short, food was amazing! The beef marmalade was remarkable. Shredded beef in wondrous flavor on a crispy piece of bread. Pulled pork burger is probably a good portion for a main meal but perfect when we shared it for supper. The flavors were again a delight to my tastebuds but I have to be honest the pulled pork could be a little more tender. Probably a 8/10 execution for the burger and 10/10 for the beef marmalade. We also ordered a smoky cocktail - the bartender burnt the sage. It was lightly sweet and not overwhelmingly strong. A great experience overall and I am definitely curious to be back to try their other main dishes, which by the way, rotates frequently. Reservations are only taken for dinner seating between 6-630pm, and walk ins usually have an hour to two wait. Or you could wing it like us, come by for a late night supper dish!"
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"I love dining alone, and this night I happened to walk-in at just the right time to catch one of the last seats available for dinner. It was outside, which was fine as it was a cool March evening. I saw many people being turned away after I sat down.    I ordered the miso eggplant, the romaine salad, the steak, and a mint ice cream for dessert. This was a bit too much food for one, I realized late, but it was fabulous! I specifically asked the waiter for the smallest cut of steak and he recommended it be done medium rare, which I don't usually do, but it was so, so, so good. The steak comes with a small salad, so the romaine salad was really unnecessary - it would have been helpful if the waiter had told me. The romaine was the least successful of the items, it was strangely salty.    Make the time for this place when you're in Singapore!"
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"I had a great meal here on a Friday evening. I made my mandatory reservation 2 months in advance for a back counter seat. I got lucky when I showed up for my 6pm reservation and was told a seat at the front counter watching the kitchen wasn't needed until 8pm. Score! It was fabulous watching the staff work like a well-oiled machine. I started with a delicious whisky drink and then had the smoked quail egg with caviar. The smokiness was lovely. Then I had the meat marmalade (minus the aioli as I'm not a fan of aioli-yummy!), pork belly with apple and raspberry purée (yum!), and the leeks (OMG good!). It was all outstanding! And let me tell you...get the leeks. They were buttery and had hazelnuts and were chargrilled. I still remember what they taste like. Just go and eat some for me."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"There are times when you do pay lots for a meal and leaving the place feeling worth every single cents? I would say this is the place.  Every thing from the food, the service and the ambiance was just wonderful.  We were lucky enough to get the seats closes to where the action is.  Seeing how the order comes in, the sou chef calling out the orders, the busy cooks scrambling to get every piece perfect and back to the chef finally taste to serve.  Think there are more than enough reviews already (will just add extremely detail pictures to tempt whose unconvinced to part with their hard earn $$) so i won't say more except the 650G beef though a S$380 hit was the best!! Also a surprise was that the dessert was good too!!  You would think BBQ guys can't do desserts?  Think again! Great job guys! Just go ahead and include 10% no need to put a big note and hint of NO SERVICE CHARGE.  You deserve every cent of it don't be shy as you are not on your Qs.My son loved their food and decide to do a video of them:youtu.be/jAWat0YZ-CE"
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"This place is so, so, SO good. Great experience, great service, great food. I cannot handle this place. Some must-orders:-Sanger- Alaskan King Crab- Meat Marmalade x1000000 plates. It's that good. - Jamaican Ginger BeerAll the food comas following a meal here are worth it. You have to trust me on this one."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"My favourite restaurant in Singapore. Burnt Ends gets it all right. The meat and seafood will blow your socks off. Dishes that at first appear super simple are, after diving in, deeply complex. This started with snow crab leg in herb butter, roasted leek, eggplant and then moved on to the ' Burnt Ends Sanger' (amazing!) & rump cap. Sounds like a lot for two, but the dishes are small and perfect to share. We finished with the sugar cake and smoked ice cream. The cocktails and wines are phenomenal, but it's the experience and theatre going on in the kitchen as you sit at the bar that seals the deal. Go here. Yeah it's not cheap, but it shouldn't be."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,Fabulous dinner on recent trip to Asia.Chef David was preparing right in front of me!  Artistry and precision behind the counter.Wait staff was terrific as well.Highly recommended in a revitalized Chinatown.
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,-1,"Sadly, a return visit in 2017 was met with a mediocre reception.  Seated outdoors due to not having a reservation, my guest and I were forgotten for about 30 minutes when the staff realized that they had not provided us with menus.Having made the recommendation to dine at Burnt Ends to my dining companion, I was sorely disappointed when the Sanger meat consistency was more of a tuna sandwich.  Other courses were, quite frankly, boring.  While I realize that Burnt Ends has made the recent top 50 restaurants in the world listing, I felt, well, burned by our experience."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Burnt Ends is really a top notch experience from a food perspective. I never had a bad dish here on any of my visits and they are combining that with an interesting beer and wine selection as well as nicely crafted cocktails and to add to that the prices are, while not cheap, very reasonable. So with this in mind and the fact that they are highly acclaimed as well it should actually be five stars and they could so easily be given that from me.The failing is however the service. Part of the service is fine and that would be the chefs behind the counter. They make the food and manage to be friendly and do a bit of talking to customers as well. The waiters and waitresses have however on every occasion been bad. First visit I asked the girl serving us how many dishes she would recommend for the two of us - response was 'how should I know howMuch you want to eat'. Great attitude. She was then mostly spending the evening doing very kittle and having another girl run around like crazy. Long waits to order, difficulty to pay have however been constant issues here but the food is so good that I keep coming back."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"You smell the food as you walk in. Open kitchen concept was also very cool. Nice to see your food prepared expertly and carefully by the chefs.Service staff was very attentive and also knew their product well, which is always a a plus for me.For my drink, I ordered their Rusty Grains cocktail, which is their very own barrel aged whiskey blend. Amazing flavor and aroma. Served simply in a whiskey glass with a nice big round ice ball. My date ordered the Happy Ending....which got a good laugh from the people next to me since I had to ask the female server for a Happy Ending....but yea all in good fun ahahaIt appears that they must have a rotating menu, (judging from the fact that there was a date on the menu hehe)Tonight we tried the Uni toast...if it's there just try it. Apparently I was the first to order as it was brand new and it certainly did not disappoint. Uni spread on a wheat toast with some toasted seaweed....oh man why can't butter be this good!Of course we had to try some steak! The server shows us the meat before the even grill it, which was a nice touch! We also had a squid pico de gallo and a pulled pork sand which.  Definitely a great date place. I will be coming back!"
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Definitely recommend the chefs tasting option. They served us highlights form across the menu, including some items that were not even on the main menu. The roasted quail was incredible. Leeks with black truffle, incredible. smoked quail egg with caviar, incredible (duh). King Crab. Beef Marmalade. Roasted corn... my mouth is watering. Drink service was awesome as well. Great cocktails and aperitifs. The wine list was really carefully curated from Australia. Unique small producers shined on the list. We did sort of a tasting across the menu since we don't really know much about Australian wines, and the drinking was about as good as the eating.The service in general also stands out. Many staff ensuring the water was full, checking to ensure we were enjoying, clearing our plates, new silver etc. I broke a wine glass on accident right when we sat down and they were right there to sweep it up and re-set the table with new water glasses, silver etc to avoid any glass shards getting in the food. (sorry about the glass!)10/10 would do it over again without hesitation."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"We went with the Omakase style (or rather, my friend ordered the omakase) so we managed to try out most of their dishes. The restaurant seating are mostly counter seats, and from there you can have a great view of the chefs scurrying across the kitchen preparing your meals. Sitting there also means you get a chance to interact with Chef Dave Pynt (and his extremely hot sous chef I think).The only problem with an open kitchen, as well as the background music, was that I couldn't hear much when the chefs introduced the dishes. For most of the dishes I didn't even know the names, really...But what I can highly recommend: - The BURNT ENDS SANGER (pulled pork burger). It was extremely juicy and flavourful, the only pity was that we had to share it among us friends. I could eat the whole thing by myself for sure! This is one of their signature dishes.- Blackmore's Cube Roll. I think this is steak that we ate. Done medium rare, it was well grilled and seasoned, and the quality of the meat was obvious. The only con to this was the almost $140 price. This is one of their signature dishes too.- Alaskan King Crab and Garlic. Oh man, the king crab was very well cooked over the garlic sauce. The sauce was well prepared, no taste of bitterness at all. Dip a piece of sourdough bread in it and devour it. Savour every last bit of the sauce. Surprisingly, this is coming from a restaurant known for their meats.If you haven't eaten at Burnt Ends, reservations (as of this past weekend) are filled till September. Talk about a long wait!Pros:- Great view of the kitchen and chefs working- Amazing food really, they are known for their meats- Good and warm service from both chefs and floor alikeCons:- Might be considered expensive; Our bill came up to about $150 per pax- Long reservation wait, if you DO manage to get it- Noisy restaurantant"
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Burnt ends is a spot that I walked in with extremely high expectations towards, with recommendations coming from multiple fronts. My gf and I dined at Andre previously and Burnt Ends was mentioned highly even from their staff so we took the plunge and made the reservation, preparing ourselves for eating some MEAT.We had the early 6 PM seating on a Wednesday so arrived right at 6 on the dot and had the first two counter seats. The ambiance immediately strikes you as a cool and hip place with old school punk rock music playing and young chefs hailing the kitchen. The open kitchen + counter seating setting is always a plus, allows you to watch and wow over the entire process from the moment you order your food, to it being announced, to preparation, to cooking, to serving. Each of their 10 visible chefs with different roles and stations - totally makes for one incredible experience even before you taste your food.We ordered the following:1) Leek with hazelnut and black truffle - nice tasting and perfectly grilled leek except was way too salty for my taste. This is subjective yes but even in being lenient, this was a bit much. The black truffle was even overpowered by the salt.2) Garlic shoots and gremolata - Great starter. Not too overwhelming of garlic.3) Fennel, Orange and Burrata - Loved the fennel and burrata but the the orange syrup was a bit too artificial tasting and didn't seem to belong. It took away from the freshness of the rest of the dish for me.4) Burnt Ends' Sanger (Pulled pork shoulder, home made cole slaw, home made chipotle aioli, brioche bun) - Loved this. Can eat 4 of these.5) Suckling pig for 2 - Good but be prepared to work! Excellent flavor from the charcoal grill.6) Burnt Ends' Sourdough - Your typical sourdough.Overall the food was nice. Definitely worth a shot but unfortunately I wasn't wow'd by any means. The Sanger was excellent and I'm sure they can make a shop purely from these. I also took a star off because of their lacking dessert and cocktail menus. Not sure if they are hoping people only eat and get out kinda thing but with the kind of setting that they have in there, an awesome cocktail and creative dessert would go long ways to make the place and experience totally memorable.Otherwise, I would recommend you check it out. I know I'll be back to checkout their new menus in the future."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Burnt Ends, owned by chef-restaurateur Andre Chiang is currently ranked No.14 in Asia's 50 Best Restaurants 2016. With Australian Chef Dave Pynt on the pass, Burnt Ends have caused quite a stir in the Singapore food scene with their incredible barbeque.During my trip to Singapore, I did not have the intention of visiting this restaurant and therefore did not make any reservations. But when I was looking at Singapore's Burpple Top 100, Burnt Ends was at the top and I just had to give it a try one way or another.With only 17 coveted counter seats, it was quite a challenge to secure a place in their restaurant. So when I tried to make a reservation during the same week, of course they were fully booked. Luckily, there are walk-in options for people that could not get a reservation.When we arrived, we were fortunate enough to snag two seats right at the end of the counter! We were so thrilled to try out what they have to offer.The way Burnt Ends operate differs from other restaurants. Approximately half of the counter seats oversee an open kitchen that is dominated by a four-tonne, dual cavity oven fired by fragrant apple and almond wood. You can also feel the hustling vibe of all the chefs and watch them as they skillfully prepare your food. I wished we were seating there instead. It would have been a totally different dining experience.We were very satisfied with the food as well as their service. Too bad there was only so much we could eat (and limited funds). There was so much more that we wanted to try on their menu - their Squid, Venison, King Crab, Seabass, it all sounds really good! They have clearly mastered their barbecuing technique and their dishes are very affordable. Until this day I am still dreaming about their perfect-rare onglet steak. I look forward to return to Burnt Ends again."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,Excellent attention to detail on everything but the seasoning which is why I can't give it a 5 star. Superb chef skills and an excellent experience - would highly recommend
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,Love the smokiness of the food. My friend did as well. The queue is fairly long so be prepared to stake it out We both loved the intense beef marmalade. The burnt sanger didn't live up to the hype for either of us. My friend also adored the fennel. I personally felt the fennel flavour was good but the actual fennel didn't have as a strong flavour as expected. I put it down as Singapore not having a great produce selection. The fennel was also a touch over smoked/burnt. The rump steak had an amazingly reduced onion puree. It was a perfectly balanced condiment to the beef. The suckling pig was probably the most underwhelming. The cider reduction was great but there wasn't a lot of it. The skin was nice and crispy. I loved the skin. The pork itself felt a little under seasoned. It was cooked very well but that was all to it. It felt like a slight dissapointment after all the other food we had.I dare say that burnt ends will continue to draw in the crowds!
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"This is a beautiful restaurant with bold, interesting flavors. It's a good thing it's so hard to get a reservation, otherwise I'd spend way too much money at this place."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Burnt Ends proclaims itself as a modern Australian BBQ, and the star of the show is certainly the grill and flaming oven.  But then again, Outback Steak also proclaims itself as an Australian steak house, but the two comparisons couldn't be further apart (thankfully). In a modern and minimal room, most of the seats are on the counter, with a few tables in the back.  The menu follows the current trend where you list only the ingredients.  So for our first course  it was simply listed as leeks, hazelnut, and brown butter.  And sure enough, that's what we got, but it was completely awesome - the leeks were grilled perfectly and sweet and tender, while the hazelnuts provided an excellent counter, and all swimming in a rich yummy bath of brown butter.  The Sanger was also one of the best sandwiches I have had in SG,  It's basically a pulled pork with cole slaw, and aioli which was super messy but on par with some of the better bbq sandwiches I have had back in the States.  The lamb with harissa was good, although my chop was a little grisly.  Do get a steak - even the cheapest version, the Onglet, is very good.  It's basically a hanger steak that is grilled perfectly on the rarer side, with bone marrow and a very rich sauce.  Service is efficient and competent.  My only complaint is that I would not serve a Belgian Abbey ale in a tall glass, but it's a minor issue and one that could be remedied with a wine glass (not perfect but certainly an improvement over a tall glass).    Anyway, DO make a reservation.  The place is small and fills up quickly, even on a Wednesday night.  And definitely try veggies as well as meats, as they handle both deftly here.  And they also have quite a few barrel aged cocktails, which I will definitely have to hit up next time.  The little plates can add up pretty quickly, but it's definitely worth it."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Delicious meal, but you gotta order carefully. Most of the dishes are very small and it's quite hard to determine which plates will make a full meal. Be sure to discuss with your waiter. The menu changes seasonally, but there are a few staples including the pulled pork sandwich (probably the best value for money on the menu). Come early, come often."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,-1,"Food was good but the service (or lack of) ruined the experience. We reserved the Chefs table for 8pm on a Wed night. We showed up at 7:45 and were told the table wasn't ready. The hostess then asked us to stand outside and order cocktails while waiting. Once we stepped outside, no one came to take our drink orders the whole time we were waiting for our table to be ready. We had to ask the waiters to clear our plates several times throughout dinner and the servers forgot to explain most of the dishes."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,-1,"Tried this place in May 2016. On the day we intended to go we tried 4 times to call for a reservation, but no one ever answered the phone. There is no functioning online reservation either so we had to play by chance by showing up without a reservation. This alone knocks down the rating...even if they are full up for the evening then at least answer the calls to inform patrons.Once we arrived (about an hour after dinner shift started), the place was bumping with people and music. Had a nice trendy vibe and decor and was exactly the type of atmosphere we had expected from the reviews. There were a couple small tables outside (both occupied) and what seemed like no vacancy inside. We asked the hostess if they had an availability for 2? She was helpful and said she'd look around. While waiting we took in some of the ambiance and surveyed the whole restaurant. The floor plan of the dining area was blended tastefully in with the kitchen, very open. The chefs were busily preparing the meals right in front of the customers. When the hostess returned, she mentioned that they only had room at a narrow steel-mesh bar adjacent to the entryway. The mesh bar sat about a foot off the wall and with black painted steel bar stools had about 5 place settings. I'm not a big fan of this type of seating for eating but for a bar it would be ok. This actually is the other reason the rating is knocked down. The mesh bar was too tight and I felt a bit uncomfortable with such little space. I mean if we're gonna drop 150+ on a meal at least design some better seating solutions."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"This is our second time to come to Burnt Ends. And it is now on our list to come every time we are in Singapore. Not only is the food excellent, but you get the full kitchen experience by watching them prepare all the dishes. It gives you a real good appreciation for what it takes to run a top notch restaurant."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,-1,"Tried this place out after all the rave reviews and hearing so much about it. Deeply disappointed. Firstly, no reservations so you have to go and get in by 6pm to try to get on the waiting list. Then you have to scoot off somewhere to have a drink or kill time. We had to wait for 1.5 hours to be seated at the side tables facing the wall. So you can't see any of the kitchen action and they were the most uncomfortable stools and tables. Unbelievable how they maximise space and charge the prices they charge and have such seats. I get it that Singapore space doesn't come cheap but still???Food was unimpressive. We had the smoked quail eggs, cauliflower dukkah (which was the most impressive dish we had that night), onglet steak with marrow, the brioche with bone marrow. The steak did not impress at all and we both felt at the end of the meal that it wasn't worth it at all. Will certainly not go back for another meal. The staff there also weren't helpful and had an attitude."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Delicious.I had heard about it from a foodie friend, and called ahead to see if we could get a spot that Friday night, which also turned out to be their opening night. Eep. Manager says come early, resto opens at 6, and they might be busy from 730, so we made plans to get there EARLY.It's 6.30, and we're pacing our walk to the resto - we didn't want to get there too early, lest we appear too eager... I lie, I really couldn't be bothered about appearing eager. After all, I was showing up on opening night, 30 minutes after they open their doors for service. And we weren't even the first ones there. Oh well. Silly accolade aside, we got down to the menu, and watched the crew work in front of us. Yes, it's one of those counter-seating placers where you get to see everything happen in front of you, and it forces the crew to be ultra clean, and ultra deliberate about every step.Yum points to the warmed oysters abd baby eggplant; the latter blackened to tasty perfection (everyone needs a little char in their lives) and with a touch of sambal on the side (with hae bi!). We also shared the roast suckling pig, which was crazy delicious- crispy crackly skin, with super juicy flesh, and Chef Dave shared that since they didn't want to take away from the pig's natural flavour, he'd let us salt the dish ourselves. Smart man.Dessert was an ice cream sandwich - really, chocolate ice cream between two brownies, and the smoked ice cream with wild hibiscus, which was a very interesting end to the night. Go ahead, imagine smoke, in ice cream, in your mouth. The come here and get all those pre-conceptions blown away."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"The food is five stars, the experience the same, flexibility and fitness for a group of friends, 2 stars. I did an extended three course lunch, and the food was realy good! Pulled pork starter was excelent, but a bit big. I might have only that one next time.The one problem I have is that they don't take reservations, and that there are few tables. They have a long counter where you can sit and see the action in the kitchen. That's great, and works fine if you are only yourself or with one friend. Wanna eat with with a group of friends, then it's a problem. Shame since the food is fantastic."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"One of a highlights of a short but fantastic Singapore food trip.A small restaurant with counter style seating. I didn't make reservations and was lucky to find seating for two even though it was late during their lunch time. I highly recommend reservations.Even though we were seat away from the kitchen half, it's a nice touch to see Chef Pynt and his excellent staff do their thing. The service was excellent and very friendly.I wasn't sure what to expect from Australian barbecue, but it did not disappoint. The Burnt Ends Sanger I think is best described as a friggin delicious twist on the pulled pork sandwich. The Cube Roll steak was also exquisite. Quail eggs were good also.Not sure I will be making many more trips back to Singapore but there's a very good reason some rank this as one of the top restaurants in the region."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,Finally got there. Awesome. Want to go back for more! Excellent service. Friendly and knowledgable staff! Food???  Well you will have to make a booking. Great smoked meats and small side dishes!
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,One of the coolest open kitchen concept restaurants! Hands down the the best hanger steak also known as the Onglet ever. It's cooked to perfection and served as a snack rather than an entrée. It takes about 45 mins from order to table but every bite is worth the wait.
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"First day in Singapore, saw all the great feedback for this place so I thought I'd give it a go... I can confidently say this this is every foodie's nirvana... Open kitchen (a sign of confidence from the chef) and everyone is sat around the comptoir overlooking the kitchen...menu is revised and changed daily... Everything on that piece of paper looked fantastic to me... Everything is super fresh, they'll even tell you when they run out of ingredients for each dish.. These guys do NOT do bulk or industrial cooking... The starters are the stars of the show... There is nothing on there that you wouldn't fancy... It's just unreal how they can ace 2 dozens different dishes everyday... I've been to many amazing places and had amazing food experiences, but I can confidently say that if I was ever to live in Singapore, this place would be one of my weekly regulars...If you love great food you'll want to marry this place..  Simply TOP NOTCH"
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Very exciting atmosphere, sitting at counter across from hard-working and dedicated chefs who are so passionate about preparing incredibly flavorful and creative food. We took a detour to Singapore on our Asian vacation just to eat at Burnt Ends, and it was SO worth it.  One of the best meal experiences I have ever had.  NOT TO BE MISSED, especially the Beef Marmalade."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"The food is excellent, let me just put it out there. If you're surfing for a place to eat on a Friday date, hurry up and go down now and chope a table (or make a reservation if you can eat at 6.30pm). The service we received however, is what made me dock a star.Let's start with the happy stuff first aka my stomach. We had the fresh pearl oysters to start. That's right, fresh and cold, not warmed (why would you warm these babies?!!). I haven't had such fresh, non-grimey, smooth tasting oysters in my life. I don't know what the chef did while he shucked these babies but man. Oysters!Then we had the grilled courgette show up with the Sanger. Think slices of perfectly grilled courgette with lovely waves of oven hei wafting in your mouth, followed by a thick mild cheese and a puree-ed vegetable 'sauce'. The pulled pork sandwich was tender, sandwiched between a willowy bun made by I'm guessing the stern looking baker lady who paced up and down to the ovens where her sourdoughs were baking. The sandwich was well sauced and had a good dose of cabbage but I *have* to say, the sauce was a little flat. It had some spice and perhaps a mayo base, but  lacked the smoke or sweetness you'd get in the South or at Smokey's in Singapore. Same same but different (interesting) take. Between these dishes and the next 2, we waited more than half an hour before realizing the servers were waiting for us to finish the burger. I was dying from hunger and it was only when I asked the waiter why 1/3 of our table got their food, did we realize there was some systematic course. Given that the menu isn't labeled as such and our host was politely *not* eating his Sanger, I'm going to bluntly say the waiters should have used their brains and asked why our plates weren't moving. Mind you once we figured this out, the kitchen still had to cook our food and we waited another 15 minutes. So the last 2 dishes were the flank steak and the king crab. The flank tends to be a cheap cut, not so much fat, since most cows have well exercised abs. This steak was grilled perfectly medium rare with some bits of fat left on top for good measure. Why would someone torture me like that? The king crab was the weakest part of our meal and word of advice, not the best thing to eat when you're having a business lunch. It wasn't bad per se, but somehow a crab leg with fibrous meat doused with butter and a squeeze of lemon didn't quite knock my socks off (now the shrimp at Blu however...).All round great food. The open kitchen is also hugely entertaining, especially when a table sent back their steak because someone messed up. Think Gordon Ramsay action without the f words yelled out loud. I saw one sous chef taste off a common spoon after putting the finishes to a plate, and place the spoon back in the common utensil basket. I squirmed for a second, but since it wasn't my dish up next, got over it. So yes, don't expect intelligent service and you'll have to push them abit if you're on work time. Otherwise, the food coming out of the kitchen is amazeballs."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Spoiled again with a dear friend and über foodie flitting through Singapore en route to London. Much anticipated, @burntends_sg didn't disappoint. We could have ordered another round of the #beefmarmaladeandpickles #perfection. Love that most of the meaty dishes can be ordered by the 100g portion meaning even 2 people can #shareplates and have variety. Intimate space, good service e.g. We were warned of the 45min wait for the rumpcap"
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,Aaaaammazing. Just ask the server what the most popular things are and order those. There is one sandwich in particular as small plate-- to die for.
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Burnt Ends makes the barbecue an exquisite affair. You wouldn't expect barbecued fare to be this polished, but Burnt Ends' mastery of the grill is inimitable. Prices are a little steep, considering the tapas portions of most dishes, but well worth it.Service was extraneously amiable and chipper in attitude, as Burnt Ends doesn't charge for service. And because the menu was impossibly succinct, scant almost, the staff's fair grasp of the menu helped inform our choices.We had:1) Smoked Quail Egg ($15 each) - topped with caviar: the minuscule mouthful costs a pretty penny, but wow was this glorious. I finally get why caviar is prized as a delicacy. These inky black pearls lent a plush briny counterpoint to the nuanced smokiness of the perfectly soft quail's egg. An absolute can't miss. 2) Tomato Toast & Lardo ($18): looked rustic but was exquisite. The blobs of tomatoes, lightly torched on the grill, were bursting with an incredible sweetness.3) Beef and Mustard ($18): my favourite version of beef tartare ever. It was clear and refreshing, the bite of the mustard restrained the rounded body of the beef.4) Burnt Ends' Sanger ($20) with pulled pork shoulder, coleslaw, chipotle aioli, and melty cheese sandwiched between a pillowy sesame seeded brioche bun: TO-DIE-FOR. Best pulled pork burger I've ever had in my life. In fact, best burger I've had in a long time. I'm still dreaming about it.5) W.A. Marron ($90) accented with kombu and gilded with tobiko beurre blanc and chives: sumptuous and succulent.6) Onglet ($35.10 for 150gm at $26/100gm) topped with burnt onion and slathered in the most divine marrow jus: Decadent and heart palpitatingly sinful but so wonderfully superb."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,-1,"You have to make reservations for 6pm / 6:30pm seatings around a week in advance, otherwise it's trying your luck 10 minutes before they open at 6pm. I thought the food was ok, but not exceptional. Had the tomahawk pork, the beef (tenderloin?), sanger and a few other dishes. The only dish I found remarkable was the almond-onion-something salad. The meat dishes I felt were meh, and the sanger had too much ""wet coleslaw"", not to mention it was on the salty side. The wine selection is good, both in terms of quality and the decent mark-up."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Ugh. So good. I practically loved every single dish we got. I had been wanting to come here after having it recommended to me so many times... and I finally did! :D so without further ado, here's what we had:Smoked quail eggs white truffle - it's good, but for the price of $12 PER EGGS i wouldn't get it again. i thought they'd at least give 2-3 eggs for that price, but no. it was really $12 for a spoonful of quail eggs and truffle - yummy, but not worth the price tag!Squid, sweet corn and paprika sauce - this is an excellent dish. i was pleasantly surprised by how juicy and soft the squid was, and the spicy yet sweet creamy paprika sauce. even the slightly charred green onions that was probably just a garnish (but I ate anyway) was tasty as hell.Onglet, onion and bone marrow - soOooO sooooo good. the chef came out and showed us the meat before it gets cooked, but i was too busy eyeing the wine list so i didn't pay too much attention. they didn't bother asking us how we'd like it done, but it came out just perfect. the meat was perfectly seared on the outside, and so juicy and so pink-tender on the inside.Burnt End's Sanger (pulled pork burger) - ok, could you tell I saved the best for last? cause I totally did. this was so good that when I first bit into it, I practically trailed off whatever conversation I was having, and all the excellent dishes we had before hand just seemed to pale in comparison. and then we got seconds - it was THAT GOOD.Banana with Caramel - this was a lovely dessert, though not much could be said about it because i was still in shock after the sanger - i felt like it really stole the show for me....anyway, i digress. the banana was nicely done and flavorful, though i feel like at that point i could have gone without dessert. thankfully it wasn't massive or anything, so we didn't struggle with it.Totally would come back here again - there were many dishes that caught my eye that I just didn't have the stomach space to try.Update (Feb 5): went back and had the following dishes:- uni with cauliflower sauce- leeks, hazelnut- corgette- toast and tomato with pancetta- sanger- flank, onion and marrow- banana caramelWill update properly when i have the chance."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,-1,"1st visit. Organized chef's table for 8. Salmon skin and crackling - okSmoked quail eggs - nicely cooked with good flavorLeeks with hazelnuts and brown butter - delicious. Fennel, orange oil and burrata - goodSquid - sweet and creamy. Will try to dothis myself at home Pulled pork sandwiches with slaw - excellent. Savory meat with creamy slaw and a fresh bun. Must. Whole red snapper - decent but a bit overpriced at $60 OP 47 days aged ribs - ours was 1.345k and costed $500.  The burnt ends were amazing but this was overpriced. Desserts - apple, pineapple and banana. Had smoked, cinnamon and caramel. Was just OK but not outstanding. 411$160 per person for dinner and wineWould I return? Not v likely bc there are other places for decent food in SG. I wouldn't say I was let down, but I did expect more from an outlet tied to Andre Chiang. At this price level, service was average. The food was good but not amazing. Simple ingredients were cooked well. Had I not ordered the ribs or sangers, I would've left annoyed as I didn't see much creativity such as Lolla or Bochinche. There weren't many wow moments for me."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"surprisingly - and I mean that in the best way - good modern offerings at this new(ish) restaurant. I used modern because I am lax to use fusion - which often has negative connotation - this place serves up what I think is a very contemporary style of food: it straddles both eastern and weatern flavors perfectly well, and meshes elements and techniques to a cohesive and (if done right) enjoyable result.n.b. if you know a less rambling way to descibe that manner of cooking, I'd be well-pleased to hear it.competitively priced, enjoyable food with some standouts, a lovely restaurant and kitchen theatrics on show, this is my thursday recommendation for friday (or any day) date night.we were on a gander through keong saik friday night when we decided to pop in and try our luck - the first to arrive on the tail of someone's canceled reservation, so we scored a seat at the counter. it's a lovely space - intimate and exclusive. there's also something infinitely pleasing about watching your food being prepared before you.we started with the truffled quail eggs - really just soft-centred boiled eggs sprinkled with tiny truffle shavings and salt: alright, though nothing particularly alluring. the sea urchin atop cauliflower mousse was quite tasty - rich, soft uni atop the mousse, with tiny pearl-type seaweed for contrasting texture. the salmon roe atop crispy fish skin was more in line with what I expected from this place - the best way to eat this is to smear the eggs evenly atop the surface, so you get a bit of salty fishiness in each bite - pretty delicious. the mains here are expertly executed - it has a lot to do with that large oven (and grill ) they operate - the food comes full of delicious smoky flavor, perfectly cooked and tender inside, but with a delicious maillard-ed crust outside. take the fish collar - I forget the species - a large white with a blackened crust, cooked flaky and tender, juicy inside and well-seasoned; and well-complemented by the crunchy mixed seaweed. the onglet was similarly impressive - marbled beef in a dark jus, topped with sliced bits of marrow. that marrow was meltingly soft and heart-stoppingly (perhaps literally) rich; and you don't get to specify the doneness of the beef here, but it's no matter - it came pink and tender and beefy.\and we finished with dessert: the recommendation of the warm apple was sweet, dark pieces of cooked fruit below a scoop of vanilla ice cream, topped with nuts. so comforting and delicious - a bit like grandma's dessert grown up.the food was of a consistently high standard (which might or might not be attributed to its pedigree), and it was well pleasing (especially for a restaurant that serves modern cuisine) that portions were fair and satisfying and prices actually reasonable. well-recommended, and a star amongst the new establishements. reminds me a little of the market grill - though this place is a little more sophisticated.p.s. they serve a suckling pig! up for advance order, and someone must have, because I saw the pig (not metaphorical) at the back. I think it's worth an order, because they hack it up and throw it on that impressive grill before serving - which must make for some deliciously charred skin and meltingly soft meat."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Love love love this place .. Its kind of small - all food are being burnt, trust t name of t restaurant .. Totally burnt t food to perfection .. e are healthy and delicious ..  Bring your own fine wine .. Their wine list is abit short  But t palette experience is worth it"
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Love this place. Consistently good food, the aged ribs are amazing. Everything on the menu is good. To top it all off, the service is fantastic, friendly, helpful, unpretentious."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,-1,"What a joke this place!!! Arrived at 7:45PM, we registered on the waiting list for 2 pax, we were told they call us back in 15 to 30 minutes...so requested for a bar where to go for a drink...the girl was not able to tell us where to go. Then, guess....they called at at 11:20PM...obviously we had already our dinner in a very nice place close by the ""joke""! By the way we went to taratata bistrot, perfect dinner!!!"
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Love this place but the recommended 5 small plates and main meal was waaay too much for 2 girls (we mentioned we weren't that hungry). Food here is great - favorite is Jacob's Ladder and duck hearts. Crackling and mustard was good too. Lettuce isn't worth your while, skip that."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"damn.  the grilled seafood was spectacular and even vegetables like leeks turned into mouthwatering yet simple spectacles in their hands. try the melt in your mouth quail egg with caviar ($15) and the intercostital cut (23) with the brown butter grilled leeks. haven't had a single bad thing here.  the waiter was a bit pushy though, asking us to order more and ahead of time though we wanted to take it slowly. be forewarned the dishes are small portions, hence pricier than average, and you're often sitting at the bar so conversation isn't the easiest in groups.  after dinner we headed across the street for another drink and snack."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Appetizers are the stars at this place. The Sanger is worth having one to yourself - it is messy, drippy, tangy, but oh so delicious."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"The good:  Everything. The bad:  Lack of seats, ventilation and seats.  The ugly:  I really racked my brain to find things they could have improved on.  Maybe they could have given me a free sample? Maybe the drink list could be longer? Maybe the almost perfect playlist could have included better songs?  Maybe it could be a little cheaper?  Nope.  It's not perfect, but it's striving to be.  I arrived prime time on the weekend and therefore got stuck facing a wall.  Despite the grated table top and needs to be painted soon bare wall, I still had an incredible experience.  Half the dishes I ordered were familiar, the other half completely new to me.  Everything was delicious.  I also noticed that the menu had the date on it, which leads me to believe fresh ingredients are being used and the plates change often.  I think a total of 4 different people served me throughout the night, one of which being the head chef.  That sort of team atmosphere was transparent every time I got to swivel around to steal glances at the chefs at work.  You could write a book on the kitchen communication (mostly combinations of body language and singular words being muttered at an extremely low decibel).  My only regret was not leaving enough room for dessert, which I hear is on par with the rest of the menu.  Luckily, that's a wrong I can right in the near future."
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,I'm definitely a fan! Highly recommended! Try it now before it goes mainstream. This is what good food os about. Reasonably priced and superb quality of food. Its a delight to see the chefs in action right on front of you.
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,-1,Mostly BBQ items.  Small restaurant with mostly counter only seating where you are up close watching the cooks.  No reservations accepted.  Most dishes are shared.  Sides were mostly good (enjoyed the tomatoes and lardo on toast and the pulled pork sliders).  Some things were under seasoned (Crackling with mustard was flavorless and bland. Needed more salt and mustard).  Sides and mains were each served one at a time.  Venison was too rare. Beef and Fish were good   $170 per person.  (Had to wait for seats so each of us had 2-3 beers and several meats).  I can't say I would return.  Experience (counter seating watching cooks) was underwhelming and food seemed over priced.  Be prepared to wait for a seat.  Friendly and well trained staff
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,1,"Wow, what an impressive restaurant and such a fun and interesting dining experience. Walking in, I felt like I was walking straight into a well organized barbeque party as opposed to a regular restaurant. This takes the open kitchen concept to a totally different level. The oven and open grills are directly in the line of sight (really, the focal piece) of the diners. It really takes you right into the heat of the action, pun intended. We ordered the following:- smoked quail eggs: This was a wonderful starter and had a deep, smokey flavour. The eggs had an almost translucent, jelly-like exterior and a runny yolk. Loved the unexpected smokiness of the eggs. A nice introduction to the running ""smoke shack"" theme of the restaurant.- squid, sweet corn and mild paprika: the squid was sweet and succulent. Loved the flavours and the crunchiness of the corn against the soft flesh of the squid. Enjoyed the plating, with the wild pop of colours. - fennel, burrata and orange oil: very interesting to watch the blackened fennel come out of the oven. It was completely ""burnt"". Sous chef will slice the fennel in front of you, revealing the perfectly grilled fennel inside. - onglet, burnt onion and marrow: the star of the show. the piece de resistence. The sear on the steak was perfect and crisp and so tender insider. It was charred to smokey perfection and tasted amazing. The natural flavours really came through; delicious.- butterhead lettuce, shallots and vinaigrette: don't belittle this side dish and do yourself a favour and order this! I enjoyed this very much as it was possibly the only dish that was not grilled or placed in the oven (or was I wrong?). The very fresh, cold and crisp lettuce provided the perfect complement to the grilled and heavier dishes. I'd say that it's an essential order and really helps to balance out the oil and fat of the other dishes. - banana and caramel: this was a small banana burnt on the outside and caramel ice-cream on the side. A smokey and sweet ending to the meal. The meal went full circle, starting out with an unexpected dish of smoked quail eggs and ending off with a grilled banana. I liked how the smoked theme played throughout the entire dinner and this really did justice to the restaurant's name.It was also much fun watching the Chef David and his crew in action and feeling like you're part of the action in the kitchen.  I thought it was genius that the kitchen did not require any frying. Everything was done on the grill and in the oven. That's altogether brilliant and daring. We arrived on a Thursday evening at around 7 pm. No queues then and we were seated straight away. Service was good too. Overall, an enjoyable evening, albeit a smokey one as we came home smelling like barbeque which was of course to be expected!"
Steakhouses,Burnt Ends,-1,"First of all, I have to specify that this review is based on my lunch there, not dinner. We started with the crackling and mustard, which is pretty much pork rinds with a mustard dip. I wasn't too impressed with it, except that the mustard was pretty good. Plus the fact that I saw them pull out the crackings from a tupperware, and it was served cold. Would have been much better if it was freshly fried. We had the sea urchin with cauliflower, which was 10 bucks a spoon. The uni was relatively fresh, and I liked how the black garlic and caulifllower puree complemented the sweetness of it, but it wasn't overwhelming good and didn't think it was worth the price tag. The grilled kingfish collar was as good as grilled kingfish kama gets, and I liked the green apple slaw that came with it. The pulled pork slaw burger was probably the best dish of all, with the juicy shaved pork and pickled slaw served with a hot brioche bun, albeit a tad heavy. I guess I came with great expectations, and I felt that it didn't deliver."
Chinese,Candlenut,1,"A chance encounter with the documentary ""Food Heros"" featuring Peranakan chef Malcolm Lee got me interested in his restaurant, Candlenut in Singapore. Here I was, a week later... and what a culinary adventure!This is not your traditional Peranakan restaurant. Candlenut features many familiar ingredients that the Straits Chinese use, but it has creatively tweaked some recipes and on occasion created something new, the Buah Keluak ice cream for one. Having a non-discriminatory palate (and an open mind) is really the best way to make the most of your experience here.We went for the cheekily named 'ah-ma-kase' set menu which came with three appetisers, soup, salad and a selection of main courses. For appetisers, we had the Smoked Octopus Acar (spicy pickle), Kurobuta Pork Satay (tender, perfectly grilled, hints of paprika, accompanied by a sweet sauce), and the exceptionally delectable Kueh Pie Tee (wafer thin crispy shells filled with tasty crabmeat, subtle hints of lemongrass).Appetisers were quickly followed by Itek Tim, a savoury-sourish duck soup. Candlenut offered an interesting twist, adding spongelike taro stem to the soup and having the duck meat served as a meatball with minced mushrooms and pickled mustard cabbage.The main courses which came in generous portions, were served communal style. Mom's Curry Prawns was my favorite - giant prawns were first lightly grilled then cooked in a delicious lemongrass candlenut curry gravy. Grilled Red Snapper (drizzled with lime juice, lemongrass-onion-chilli sauce) was another outstanding dish. Duck Curry, aromatic from various ground spices, was cooked in a rendang style with the coconut curry thick and creamy. Wok-fried Pork Slices was another winner. Sautéed with prawn chilli sambal and shredded kaffir lime leaves, it delivered a remarkably fiery punch, punctuated by the distinctive citrusy notes of the lime leaves. Prawn Wing Bean Salad offered a refreshing light contrast to the other main dishes but as this was nearly the only greens in the set, I would have loved for it to come in a bigger serving. After a complimentary palate cleanser - lemongrass granita, we moved on to desserts. The Mao Shan Wang Durian Ice Cream was every bit as mouthwatering as its pedigree would have you anticipate. It was also a pretty scoop adorned with flowers and a rose cookie. Steamed Banana Cake was light and fluffy, pairing beautifully with the accompanying Gula Melaka ice cream. However the star in this section belonged to the Buah Keluak Ice Cream. Savoury bits of the distinctive earthly nut were mixed into the ice cream and there was also the delightful crunch of salted caramel. What a brilliant combination of flavours and textures.Traditional Peranakan cuisine will always be a part of Singapore's food culture. Notwithstanding, I applaud Candlenut's creative flair, and courage in pushing boundaries, and for its ambition to elevate Peranakan cuisine to levels of fine dining. Afterall didn't Peranakan cuisine evolve from an innovative fusion of cooking techniques and ingredients of 2 or more distinct cultures, necessitated in part by a need to adapt? Kudos, Chef Lee and his team."
Chinese,Candlenut,-1,"Came here to try Michelin Star fine dining restaurant. It was featured in the AAA magazine. They are known to use local ingredients featuring Peranakan cuisine.Service is relatively attentive. There was a minor incident that annoyed me. We ordered the prix fix and an a la carte dish, the waiter decided to not put down my request believing we may not finish the food. (I think it is is lame excuse that he forgot)The tasting menu is as followsStarts off with shrimp chips with spicy dipping sauce.Kieu pee tee with Bermuda tartare- great beginning love the crispy shell and the tangy fillingMaori lamb skewer- well marinated lamb that cuts the game and gain the flavorDumpling seafood bisque-full bodied seafood soup ( not really a bisque) with dumpling ( not very good dumpling the skin tasted doughy)The next course is family style of various dishes with white rice:Star fruit salad- refreshing palate cleanser between eating the heavy sides with there were more!Squid curryAn xin chickenCod fish tau cheo *Beef randan *Sambal telur And braised porkThe stated dishes were my favorite they paired well with the Starfruit salad. Very developed flavors of umami and spices The desserts was my favoritesCoconut shaved ice was a real cleanser from the heavy sauces dishes. It really calmed you after a stormThe nyonya Kueh selections were a delight paired with blue sweet pea blossom tea. I gave it 3.5 stars because of not getting the a la carte dish when it was our conscious decision. And not all the sauces dishes were to our palate. Kinda on the heavy flavor side. I hade to get two bowls of rice to eat the sauces dishes. The ambience is clean and comfortable. Very fusion tropical. I do recommend this place for a date if you are in Singapore"
Chinese,Candlenut,-1,"Dining here was not the experience that I expected. The only good thing was the service which was impeccable, but one cannot eat the service. It can only go thus far. The ambiance was disappointing and the decor was dated.The food was doubly disappointing as well. The blue crab dish was good but other elements left a lot to desire. The dessert was the worst. It reminded me of a mixture of frozen artificial fruit juice, jello, ice chips and fake honey.Ambiance: 5/10Noise level: 6/10, 1 being the noisiest.Flavor: 6/10Taste: 5/10Return factor: 1/10Recommend: 4/10."
Chinese,Candlenut,1,"""Something taste like lemon Dawn""  I whisper.""Right?"" Whispers my dining companion through giggles.And that began what unbeknownst to me would be one of the best meals in Singapore.It just goes to show that you should not start off exploring a country's food with the most difficult to understand, and highly refined.Candlenut is a Michelin one star Peranaken restaurant in the heart of Dempsey. The food is uniquely Singaporean, the joining of Chinese and Malay food using the local ingredients.The dining space, part of a large warehouse, does not at all resemble a Michelin restaurant however, the food speaks for itself.Begin with a number of small plates. All dishes are meant to be shared. The kueh pie tee crispy shell stuffed with crab meat, seasoned with curry, and a bit of pickled shallots, almost taste of laksa.  The wing bean salad with baby radish, lemongrass, cashews in a calimansi lime dressing, the definition of texture. Extremely refreshing. Finally the crispy pork belly with pickled greens, outstanding. Think of the best Filipino lechon topped with crisp pickled veg, it's tight sour grip finishing with a gentle fermented seafood flavor. Excellent complexity.Mains crisscross the country. An excellent wagyu beef rendang, tender and extremely flavorful wrapped in a slury of cumin, turmeric, turmeric leaves, and other spices, wallops the pallet. The spice mix penetrates the meat all the way to its deep core. Not to be out done, a dish called ""Mum's Curry"" is equally deeply flavored. Tender, juicy chunks of chicken and potatoes and a deep rich curry mixture. Fresh peppers brighten the dish. Both are perfect spooned over some rice.The dish of the evening, red lion snapper simply cooked in a fresh chili sambal with charred garlic chives; incredible. The sweet flavor of the fish is accented beautifully by the fiery sambal.  A squeeze of calamansi brightens the flavor. Desserts, are also outstanding. It is hard to fault the Kueh salat with bangkit crumble and young coconut sorbet.  Hawaii yeeps, think of the best custard mochi you've ever had, add a light, refreshing, coconut supercharged sorbet and you have this dish.Service is informal and very friendly. As with most South East Asian countries, you must flag the server if you want something.Nice selection of wine however there is no better match to the food than beer considering the spice levels.Reservations required.Impressive to say the least. Save this for your final meal in the country and it will all make sense.Thank you Singapore."
Chinese,Candlenut,1,"As long as you don't come here with really high expectations it was a good meal. The place was empty on a weds night and started filling up after 8. Keep in mind they don't seem to have a bar and serve mostly wines and beers. We got the omakase, the most memorable dish was the beef rendang. I'd come here for a chill dinner if your willing to pay for it."
Chinese,Candlenut,-1,"When I heard we were going to Candlenut for lunch, I was excited since I'm a fan of peranakan food and I've heard good stuff about it too. Ambience is nice... the place is done up really nicely decor-wise and it felt quite sophisticated yet traditional. There were 6 of us so we ordered a good variety of dishes to share. My favorite dish was the charcoal grilled whole squid with fresh yellow tumeric sambal - really tender and fragrant, and was complemented well with the sambal, which was very flavorful. I'd also recommend the babi pongteh (braised duroc pork cheek pongteh) which was super tender. The ayam buah keluak was tasty too though I wish they left the whole nut inside for the experience... The one thing I wished though was if the server had asked us if we wanted to have a portion of the homemade sambal belachan to try - $2 per sharing portion. I mean... yes it's on the menu, and I don't agree with having to pay for it, but the point is that they didn't even ask... and I found the food not spicy enough.. it's a peranakan restaurant after all right?Dessert was expensive and absolutely nothing to shout about. I'd give it a miss if I find myself back there. Overall, not too bad ""refined"" peranakan food but I think you can find better elsewhere for cheaper and with more character."
Chinese,Candlenut,-1,"With expectations set high on the worlds first Michelin starred Paranakan cuisine restaurant, I must admit that I was quite unfortunately, disappointed.  From the inattentive waiters and waitresses to the seeming slight imbalance in flavours (with perhaps an overly abundant overload on the quite heavily salted buah keluak) and lack of the expected extra ""finer details"" characteristic of highly praised restaurants in similar food eschelons, the experience was quite disappointing all around.  I will say, however, that granted, the flavours, portions, and service could be improved the dishes are quite photogenic."
Chinese,Candlenut,-1,"It was my first trip to Singapore, and I was beyond excited to visit the haven of street food and Michelin Stars. I was glad to have found just one Michelin restaurant with Singaporean roots. I honestly must say, I was disappointed. Singaporean food, boasting strong flavors and rich spices, was not accurately reflected in the meal I had.The jackfruit curry was mild in flavor, without the strong spice flavors.The sambal was very tender, but the meat was quite shredded and the flavor, again, not as strong as the rich street foods we had tried.Singaporean food all should have strong enough flavors that require it to be paired with rice, but my rice bowl was still near full. Some advice for visitors: although Singapore may have the most number of Michelin Starred restaurants, if you want a local Singaporean experience, stick with the food markets and the local restaurants to truly get the Singaporean eating experience."
Chinese,Candlenut,1,"Candlenut @ DempseyGone upmarketAmbience much nicer than before.In premises shared with a Japanese restaurant, a mini Market, a bar in the centre of the premises and at the other end a French restaurant.The waitresses are no longer in kebayas. Why? Because it doesn't fit the new image.Saw the Chef walking around in a suit!Satay didn't have much of a satay sauce. It was just grilled meat. This was much better previously. They shouldn't have changed it!Crispy bean curd skin ngor hiang (minced pork, prawns & water chestnut) - not fragrant. The one at Singapura Seafood Restaurant is better.Wild caught baby squid, sambal belachan cherry tomatoes & red onions texture of squid was tender, sauce was good, cherry tomatoes good too. Overall it is tasty but a tad saltish.Tiger prawns, petai beans, tamarind & shallots - prawns don't quite look the size of tiger prawns. Candlenut's classic chendol cream, Pandan jelly & Gula Melaka - Super sweet.Food was very good before. Tonight it was only average. I would say it's okay tonight but unfortunately not worthy of its Michelin Star."
Chinese,Candlenut,1,"Great food and excellent service.The best thing we tried was the Wagyu Beef Rendang, but we also enjoyed the charcoal grilled chicken satay, water spinach and Kueh Pie Tee. All were tasty. The fish chips they bring to start are also delicious."
Chinese,Candlenut,-1,"Can't be worse for customer service. Refused to let in customers who came 3min after 230pm as the ""kitchen had closed"". If you can have an incremental revenue, and there isn't significant incremental cost to opening the kitchen, it just boils down to inflexibility and a distinct lack of customer service and empathy. We had to make significant sacrifices to our schedule and beat the crazy Singapore traffic to just get here and then get turned away. There have been many other restaurants that have been many times more accommodating. Well, it is the first time I am here and it will probably be the last time that I am. Even though I never ever got a chance to taste the food, it has left me a strong and nasty taste."
Chinese,Candlenut,1,"Candlenut serves modern/fusion Peranakan food, and in our opinion, quite well. They moved from Chinatown to COMO at Dempsey. While the dining area is a little haphazard, there is a weird charm to it. We ate here before and after the star, and tried both omakase menu and ala carte items. The dishes are always on point. Waitstaff and cheerful and pleasant. Needless to say, we will be back."
Chinese,Candlenut,-1,"The decor was rustic with straw lamp shades. Fast service. We had starters with satay, stewed vegetables that you scooped into fried pastry cups and prawn crackers. Then mains with steaming hot rice, beef rendang coconut strength, vegetables in mild spicy sauce and coconut water from the shell. Good service with older waiting staff. KK had the chendol or green jelly with coconut. The flavors smacked of Singapore in the 21st century. The charm of old Melaka in the food was cloaked by the modern Sporean fog."
Chinese,Candlenut,-1,"The whole experience was disappointing to me. The food wasn't especially tasty there, even the garnish was so common that from nowhere I could tell this is a one star Michelin restaurent. Portion was small. The environment itself was ok but not as good as expected. Not sure about Singapore but with this price I would expect something nicer and more grand. Overall, wouldn't recommend this place."
Chinese,Candlenut,1,"I actually think this is a great restaurant. All the items we ordered were excellent. Not only they were very tasty, they were also very unusual. The fried rice were black due to the spices but were incredibly tasty. Price was expensive but it is worth for special occasion."
Chinese,Candlenut,-1,"Bad attitude Reservation Lady. Zero service. Our first time to this place. Walking into Candlenut, the place has a great ambience which makes you feel like you will be having a good night and great food. Was looking forward to it. The problem is the ATTITUDE of the Reservation Lady. We booked a week before and she said couldn't find our name. Arrogance And Pompous ATTITUDE not to mention slowness and lack of response No APOLOGY And ARGUMENTATIVE. And all these was played out in front of the kids. It was so embarrassing. With the hype on this place, being a one Michelin , we had our expectations heighten too but it is intolerable not to have someone who understands customer relationship management. This was supposed to be a special night out but she messed it up."
Chinese,Candlenut,1,"overall tasty fusion modern peranakan (Chinese Malay) with good service in a nice open lively setup in Dempsey.  not sure why the other reviews are harsh.  the portions are quite small but allows for sampling.  ""ahma kase"" menu available but tried a la carte: Homemade Kueh Pie Tee Shell Hamachi Tartare, Pickled Shallot, Laksa Leaf Pesto, uniqueWing Bean Salad, Baby Radish, Lemongrass, Cashew Nuts, Prawns, Calamansi Lime Dressing, great texture and refreshing flavorBuah Keluak of Braised Local Chicken with Peranakan Signature Black Nut Sambal, unique flavor, slightly dry but like a oaxacan moleGrilled Spice-marinated Blackmore Wagyu Beef Satay, yummyBlue Swimmer Crab Curry Turmeric, Galangal, Kaffir Lime Leaf, bold flavor and tastyBaby Sweet Potato Leaves Spicy Dried Shrimp SambalWestholme Wagyu Beef Brisket Rending Serunding, Turmeric Leaf, soft and flavorfuldessert with the buah keluak and chocolate also worked very well."
Chinese,Candlenut,-1,"This restaurant should more accurately be described as a peranakan fusion restaurant. I am a peranakan and frankly have not sampled an authentic peranakan restaurant in Singapore. Since this is a fusion restaurant, I did not have high hopes, in spite of them having won a Michelin star. The restaurant decor is sparse but pleasant. Service was very attentive and really friendly. 5 stars. They had a regular menu you would expect from this type of restaurant, but with twists to the traditional recipes.  For example, the ayam buah  keluak had decent flavor but the emphasis was the chicken, whereas traditional food is the opposite. Likewise the prawn petai, flavors were there, but the emphasis was the fresh prawns, not the petai. All in all the food was decent, but not spectacular.  If you are expecting authentic peranakan, you will be disappointed. However they were true to their advertisement, fusion peranakan. A downside was the pricing, quite expensive, about $70 per person."
Chinese,Chef Kang's,1,"Fried fish in soup - very good, think it's even better than the one at Paradise Teochew Restaurant.Wasabi prawns - okay but don't like it stickyChicken in a cage - niceCoffee pork and sweet pork (again that sticky stuff which I don't care for). I like the coffee pork.Tofu, shiitake mushrooms and broccoli - very nice especially the tofu.Fried kway teow - a bit burnt like it should be with prawns, vegetables and scallops - nice but I wish it wasn't sticky/starchy.Coconut pudding with coconut ice cream - some of us like it but not me.Lemongrass jelly - lovely.$77 per head."
Asian Fusion,Cheng Heng Kway Chap And Braised Duck Rice,1,"Awesome braised duck! I love it. And it's often closed when I visit, sadly. The line is so long whenever I visit but it is definitely worth the wait. I still forget what days the store is closed. Because of the huge crowd, it is possible for the duck to run out. I have had it happen to my Friend. The duck is soft and tender and there's also really delicious braised pork. The egg and the tau Pok is good too. The braise sauce is very flavourful but yet the meats are still tender. Very worth it for $3! The rice sadly, is not yam rice, but is normal rice. Just get lots of sauce from the auntie! Two cute aunties working together. Delicious duck and sauce! Cheap and good deal, will be back often."
Asian Fusion,Cheng Heng Kway Chap And Braised Duck Rice,1,"Wow! Now i know and understand what the queue is about. Luckily for me, I was the third in queue and almost wanted to leave the queue. But I stuck on as I also dunno what else to eat. What a great choice I made to stay in the queue. I ordered kway chap with:* braised egg* daupok * pork belly slices * fish cake* preserved Vege All this for $3.50!!!!The braised pork belly slices is not funny kind of nice! Super flavourful! The braised sauce is good thus the Kway chap also shiok! My only complain is that the egg's outer layer is a little tough. Other than that, I had an awesome lunch!!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade Golden Palace,1,"QQ Dumplings: 3.5 starsLooks like an adorable little elephant (???).  Chewy rice flour ??? dough.Prawn with Mango: 1 starI really didn't like this dish.  It tasted like that cheap kind of mayonnaise/cream cheese-based dish at Americanised Chinese restaurants and was too heavy and sweet.Noodle Roll with Salted Egg Yolk: 5 starsThis was amazing.  It's a cheong fun exterior wrapped around the crispy fried lattice like those that come on taro puffs, and filled with salted egg yolk.  Dip it in the savoury cheong fun sauce and it blows your mind.Black Bao: 4 starsXiaolongbao (soup dumpling) filling in an exotic-looking steamed bun."
Chinese,Crystal Jade Golden Palace,1,What an amazing experience! Food was perfect and service was also. Pork belly was fabulous and the Peking duct was delicious. Will certainly go back.
Chinese,Crystal Jade Golden Palace,1,"Great service, great food. the dim sum dishes we had were really good. to highlight some of them...the salted egg fish skin was really flavorful and crispy. so was the deep friend ""white rice"" fish. The char siew bao were soft and fluffy with great yummy filling on the inside. My favorite is the deep friend minced meat turnover. you don't get that in every dim sum restaurant here in Singapore so I am always very happy to find it on the menu and this particular one was very well made with a crispy exterior and a chewy glutinous interior. Not greasy at all.To avoid disappointment, I highly recommend making a reservation before heading down."
Chinese,Crystal Jade Golden Palace,1,"Very nice ambience and excellent food. Meals were served fast, service was good as well."
Chinese,Crystal Jade Golden Palace,-1,"Crystal Jade- an appropriate name for a restaurant located within a mall that exudes elegance and sophistication. In this establishment you are to experience traditional dim sum perfected and refined to fit a high-class dining experience. I think at least, I've barely eaten anything.As I write this we're about 40 minutes into service and have received only 2 of 8 dishes that we had ordered. They did let us know upon entering that we would only have 1 hour since we didn't have a reservation, which is fine, dim sum barely takes any time at all! Come to find that again, each dish is taking rather long and tables around us are being fed multiple dishes before we've received our 3rd. We've gotten LOADS of tea though, they are very good at pouring and restocking our tea. Which is all we've been doing because there's nothing else to consume on this table.The dishes we did have are fine. They're fine. Worth the 40 minute wait? I'm going to have to reserve judgment since I've yet to taste our remaining 6 items.Our waitress let us know that there were complications in the kitchen, but I find that extremely hard to believe when most other tables have been served many plates of food and we are the only table that has been neglected. The only redeeming factor about this experience is that I ate beforehand. Despite that, this wait is inexcusable and I would exercise caution when dining with Crystal Jade.Update: We've finally received all of our food in exactly 1 hour. I can't imagine that they'd give us grief about staying here longer because we need to eat. My final judgment- it's fine. I can't imagine myself wanting this again or wanting to recommend it to friends. So as there is nothing exceptional being served here, I would only dine here if it is strictly convenient or you are dying of hunger. But even in the latter case you may be forced to wait some time so it may be a lost cause."
Chinese,Crystal Jade Golden Palace,1,"Dim Sum LunchBest was the service from Ms Goh Chai Hong who helped me with a bag all the way to the entrance as I was in crutches. So kind of her.Ms Goh also offered my Friend and I shawls if we felt cold.White bait - lovely; light and crispy and not oily - very good.Teochew crystal skin dumplings with chives - good but I don't like the taste of chives, can be a little green.Meatballs - not bad although I am not into meatballsPomfret fillet porridge - goodDried Chilli shrimps on rice rolls - very niceXO sauce carrot cake with egg and bean sprouts - good"
Chinese,Crystal Jade Golden Palace,1,"Amazing Chinese food! No matter it's the toasted pork, Peking duck or crab egg xiaolongbao, the restaurant did every dish to a perfection. Love the xiaolongbao, the crab yellow was so creamy, and generous in size. It explodes your senses. The hairy crab is a seasonal speciality and only available till mid November. Do not miss out your quota for the year. :) I tried the fried noodle pizza for the first time. The idea is to cut the pizza-like flat thin noodle into small pieces. First spread a thin layer of sugar, and use a spoon to drip a few drops of vinegar. Viola, crispy, slight sweet and sour. I never ate deep fried food, but was tempted to finish almost one slice..Steamed sea bass was also a delicacy. One spoon of fish soup into rice, and eat it with the fish, rich and yet refreshing.The staff was well trained, friendly and very attentive, made all the right recommendations. The restaurant also sells its own branded chili sauce and xo sauce."
Chinese,Crystal Jade Golden Palace,1,"This was our second time at Crystal Jade. This time we sat at the bar because we didnt make a reservation but the staff here as usual were super friendly and nice they always make me feel welcome. The bar area was actually quite comfortable. I ordered a few things such as the duck egg fish skin, soup dumplings, custard buns, pork belly and foie gras. However, minutes after there was some kind of alarm and apparently one area of the kitchen had water sprinkler going off and it was the area that made the pork belly and foie gras so were not able to get our dishes. The fish skin was delicious it was light and not too heavy with the egg yolk. The soup dumplings unfortunately all explored and we lost the broth in the dumpling. The custard buns were great!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade Golden Palace,1,"It's probably best if I didn't tell you how often I was at this restaurant for Sunday dim sum brunch. Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous. I manage to con different friends to get my dim sum fix at this place week in and week out. Because their dim sum is just.that.damn.good.What's not to love about little pillows of shrimpy/porky goodness???There's nothing happier to life than baskets of dumplings flowing towards your table to be consumed. Each of this little morsels are crying out EAT ME. So I do. Shrimp dumplings, xiao long bao, teochew crystal dumplings, cute little jumbo shaped dumplings, XO fried carrot cake, shrimp rice rolls, beancurd rolls, etc. etc. You just can't go wrong. Ask for the  (doubanjiang) for dipping and you're good to go. Because everything tastes better with a little chili kick. -1 star for service because they never seem to get it quite right."
Chinese,Crystal Jade Golden Palace,1,"Really like this place for dim sum lunch.  Great venue, better food, ok service (...even though after the one Michelin star it got way too busy)"
Chinese,Crystal Jade Golden Palace,1,"It has been a few years since I revisited this place, and I was glad I did. The dimsum still maintained their usual standard, and I just generally find their decor very tasteful, and it is a great place to catch up with friends. I can't think of a single dish that stood out as being outstanding, but the general caliber of the dim sum is pretty damn good. I like the good service here as well, and that it's not too loud compared to other dim sum joints."
Chinese,Crystal Jade Golden Palace,-1,"Unnecessarily cold: Four stars for food but the temperature of the restaurant make it virtually unsuitable for children and most adults (we brought a three-month old and a toddler). I asked two staff members to see if they could raise the temp but one said it wasn't possible and the other said ""oh we just got the air con serviced so it's much colder now...I can't adjust it"". I'll assume he's speaking factually and CJ should assume I am too when I say we won't be back."
Chinese,Crystal Jade Golden Palace,1,"I remember coming here with my cousin, the food was really and the service was good as well. I would recommend coming here if you visit Singapore!"
Chinese,Crystal Jade Golden Palace,1,"Mixed-menu - this restaurant serves Cantonese and Teochew food. I would recommend the Teochew goose, cold crab, bamboo clams and their daily soup. The pig's stomach soup is also excellent - I highly recommend that - the soup is peppery, and the texture of the stomach is done to a precise consistency - not too soft or tough and very palatable.Great ambience and great food makes this a perfect place for family dinners. The service at this Paragon restaurant is also excellent, I couldn't recommend it enough. The waiters are attentive and professional."
Chinese,Crystal Jade Golden Palace,-1,very good chinese food.. ridiculously expensive.. the bbq duck is excellent.. our friends enjoyed their winter melon soup.. cereal prawns are excellent.. service was also quite attentive.. the reason it doesn't score higher is the price.. maybe i'm used to prices in southern california or vancouver where you can also get world class chinese food
Chinese,Crystal Jade Golden Palace,1,"Another one of my favorite Teochew restaurant, the other being East Ocean. Great service good food but n the pricier side"
Chinese,Crystal Jade Golden Palace,1,For a foreigner this was a great experience. Good authentic Chinese food. Didnt know what I was eating but all goiod.
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"One of the best steaks I have ever tasted.We went with the porterhouse steak and it was good for two people, portion wise. It comes with two sauces and 4 different mustards. The steak was very well prepared in terms of flavor and we really enjoyed it. Ordered kale and the patata as sides. The patata was really good as well.Finally went with the chocolate and the caramel dishes for dessert. They were ok but nothing special, wouldn't mind skipping them next time."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"One-star Michelin steakhouse in MBS. Expensive high quality steak. Had the trio of beef to sample different cuts - New York Sirloin, Wagyu, and USDA Prime. Both the NY sirloin and the USDA prime were top-notch but the Wagyu was a let-down. Definitely had better wagyu beef elsewhere...Portions are small, especially when considering the price. So overall the steak alone would be 4 star.Starters are amazing - we ordered the sautéed mushroom and patatas bravas - definitely one of the best starters I have had in a whileIf you don't eat beef, the pork chop is excellent - juicy and tender with a very good complementary sauce. Large wine selection but unfortunately sommelier wasn't the most helpful. We asked for a red wine recommendation and he basically pointed to so many that it misses the point of being a recommendationService was really slow and not attentive / definitely not what we would expect from this type of restaurant. Mediocre service counters the 5-star starters to give a 4* rating."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"There are few tv celebrity chef restaurants that I've been to that have truly delivered with the menu.  We stopped in only for drinks (which were divine) and after several drinks we were persuaded to get these mini tuna taco sliders.  I've had similar dishes at other restaurants (think tuna tartar). These were so good, they had both my boyfriend and I talking about them the following day."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,Superb service. You can't expect anything less from Wolfgang Puck's restaurant. And it's at the Marina Bay sands hotel so the standards are high when dining here.Plenty of steaks to choose from. They also make some good cocktails.Again service was great. They kept coming back ensuring that my needs were met. Reservations are recommended although I'm sure they can squeeze you in.
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"Dined here a few weeks ago.  Crab cakes, butter lettuce, filet with the apple crumble dessert.  Enjoyed it very much. Filet was excellently prepared. Would definitely return here next time."
Steakhouses,CUT,-1,"Event Planners - Beware! I am an event planner and had a very disappointing experience. I gave 2 stars because the food and service was good, the management team organizing was not. I felt they were dishonest with the amount of wine my group consumed which we have no choice but to pay because I was not onsite to confirm. I was also charged a higher amount on wine as they didn't have the type I chose of which I am still awaiting a refund, from early March. The communication has been slow and not genuine. My concerns were expressed multiple times and still have not heard from a manager."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"Mr. Puck is - next to Arnie - one of the more famous and successful Austrian ""exports"". He now ranks amongst the best chefs/restaurateurs in the world, and ""Spago"" in LA is an institution that has found worldwide fame, now present in many locations, Singapore included. Another venture of his is CUT, focusing on steak. We booked there for our wedding anniversary and enjoyed it tremendously.As there are many other reviews raving about this place I'm trying to keep it short, hoping to contribute to a coherent picture.Service is very friendly, efficient, and, which I always find refreshing at ""celebrity restaurants"", authentic. No snobbishness, just smiles all around, staff greeting repeat customers with true joy of seeing each other again. A rare trait at this kind of place.Interior is modern/elegant, darkish, with great lighting, and the wonderful celebrity portrait photography by Martin Schoeller featured in the entire location and on menus.Food is delicious- I won't go into detail, we had crab/shrimp cocktail starters, steak and dessert - and it arrives pretty fast, which we did not expect with the restaurant being very busy.The wine list features a great many choices and we really enjoyed our Pinot Noir from California. Prices for wine are on the steep side, but I guess this isn't news to anyone in Singapore..I really enjoyed the background music as it was a very good mix of old classics (e.g. David Bowie) and contemporary (e.g. Coldplay) - a daring choice but a good change from ""the usual"". Toilets are very sleek and very clean, and so big!I cannot think of anything else to describe and would just mention at this point that the restaurant is located in a luxury shopping mall, which is of some benefit if you want to coax your significant other into visiting Gucci post-dinner.. (didn't work for me but one can always try ;-))"
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"I took myself on Valentine's Day after working a long day. For starters, the bread was delish. I preferred the pretzel bun with the soft butter. I ordered a nice glass of red wine with help from their sommelier. I also got the ribeye and the potatoes. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, medium rare. And it was a nice cut. Those potatoes were fabulous! Roasted, smashed, then crisped and garnished with lots of savory onions! For dessert, I splurged and got the chocolate soufflé. Oh. My. Goodness. This is literally in my top 3 desserts. Ever. It was just pure delight and not too chocolatey. When the soufflé arrived, the waiter topped it with melted chocolate, a dollop of whip cream, and then topped it with more chocolate. Gah! I also got a glass of sweet red wine, which was a nice accompaniment to the soufflé. I'm drooling now as I think of that delicious meal! Enjoy! Oh! And I almost forgot! They gave me a long stem red rose and a box of homemade chocolates. They were fabulous! I didn't see them give them to the guys at the table next to me so thanks for making my day!"
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"I recommend making reservations because as a walk-in, they are most likely going to seat you in the lounge where shoppers gawk at you through the window as they walk by. Not a great ambiance, all things considered. The steak tartare was a tad under seasoned but the richness of the quail egg yolk made up for it. I wouldn't order it again, truthfully. The menu is pretty straightforward. I wanted the porterhouse so Jerry and I ordered the portion for 2. Little did we know it's 1 piece cooked and divided in half. I wanted rare and he wanted medium-rare. It was a little weird that they brought the steak out to me to have me look at it first before cutting it. They then walked over to Jerry to confirm his medium-rare wishes so they can continue to cook it. I got the bone marrow and my colleagues ordered a few side items. I forgot what it was but I remember not a single of them complained or said anything negative about the taste, presentation, and quality of the food. The bone marrow was tender. It melted in my mouth. It was so rich, I felt guilty as I was eating it but it was too good to stop. I wish they served it in a ramekin instead of a plate though. The porterhouse was tender. Their house made steak sauce was delicious. The steak was seasoned perfectly and did not need any flavor enhancements but a taste of their steak sauce was addicting so I kept adding. Finally time for desserts. I was the only one that wanted desserts. I ordered the chocolate soufflé. Knew that it would take at least 15 minutes for it but ordered it and was waiting anxiously for it to come out. The portion is pretty massive so you can share if you please but I don't share when it comes to food so I enjoyed it, orgasmiscally until it was all gone. Their crime fraiche was thick and creamy, the chocolate sauce was rich, the ice cream was more frozen but it melted beautifully and sinfully w/ the huge, decadent, and delicious chocolate soufflé. Service was impeccable. 10% off for MasterCard users. Thanks for allowing us to expense this!!! Love my company."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"I took my husband here for his birthday while in Singapore and this is hands down one of the best restaurants we've been to. The server was A+ & so was dinner. My favorite was my mocktail (apple, cucumber, & basil).What a great experience? Needless to say, he enjoyed his birthday."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"This has got to be the best steak house I have ever experienced. I am formerly of New York City and had my fair share of solid steaks. I've even frequented CUT restaurants in other locations including Los Angeles and Dubai. But for some reason, the entire experience from the moment of making a reservation to the final touch of the best desserts make this restaurant not only the best CUT but also one of the best restaurants in Singapore.What also makes this place that much greater is their cocktail and wine selection. Their cocktails definitely among the best in Singapore - fresh ingredients and creative ""mixology"" similar to rival bars that make their living off this kind of stuff (the only ones I've found in SG so far that can even compare to the creations here are Bar Stories on Arab St. and Nutmeg and Clove on Club St.). You can even come here for the drinks alone and enjoy - my favorite is Duke of Earl - a cocktail they make with their own earl grey infused gin. Also love their ""spiked"" Thai Iced tea. :)Anyways for the food, their Kobe beef is unreal. Frankly, you can't go wrong with any of their steaks.Lastly, their dessert. They also have the best dessert I've ever had in my life. HIGHLY RECOMMEND their Baked Alaska which has kaya ice cream inside. UNREAL!!!!!!!!!! Make it a mission to stop by here for any or all of these three reasons - drinks, steaks, dessert. Every person I've brought here ends up loving it as much as I do and for good cause. You won't be disappointed. :)"
Steakhouses,CUT,1,Best steaks in town!The Kobe steak is just amazing! I had the filet mignon. The pork belly starter was also really good.
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"I've been dying to try this place for a while now, finally got to try it last night. Ordered the U.S. filet mignon, UK ribeye, Hokkaido scallop carpaccio, creamed spinach, & wild mushrooms. The cook on the filet mignon was great! The portions were just right for my boyfriend and I. Though we were stuffed at the end of the meal, we couldn't help but try their desserts. The kaya baked Alaska was to die for! It wasn't too sweet, so it was perfect !!Also had the sweet wine & port."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"Came here on a pretty amazing, random whim with a great gentleman & his crew while visiting Singapore. My goodness... The presentation & flavor of the drinks & food were AMAZING. And orgasmic. How they made carrots, Mac & cheese, mini Kobe burgers, fish tacos, & potatoes (all separate dishes) taste like culinary heaven is beyond me. The bartender and servers were courteous & lively which definitely amped up the atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoyed myself."
Steakhouses,CUT,-1,"Went here for dinner. I had the Australian porter house. My steak was bland, no flavor, and had a lot of fat not trimmed, and rare was done as medium well. Informed my waiter and she just said she will let manager know."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"I really don't have much negatives to say about this place despite it being twice as more expensive than the LA version, which usually annoys me.  From what I recall, they had some kind of discounts if you make it before the happy hour ends. We came here for our anniversary dinner few months back, and the service, atmosphere, and the private enclaved seating in some areas well catered to our celebration. I am a bone marrow fan and it didn't disappoint, unlike the one in Osteria Mozza across the street (though I'm also a long-time fan of that restaurant). It was juicy, flavorful, and exactly messy and authentic as the ones I'd eat in New York.  D usually gets the RIb Eye, and I get the Filet Mignon paired with a simple creamy horseradish, and both were on point.  On the side, caramelized white sweet corn and creamed spinach are our usual pair. Overall, a place to go in Singapore when you're missing some good quality meat in your life!"
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"This is probably the best steak house in Singapore ! We ordered the wagu grade 8 steak. It literally melt in our mouths ! We started with the tuna tartar. ExcellentThen we had the steak that was shared.  Heaven Wine was ok , on the expensive side.  They won't allowed us to bring our own !  A bit of a downer We finished with sweet port n chocolate soufflé. A highly recommended place if u are willing to spend at least $200+ per person."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"Quite expensive, but truly worth the price I feel. I just loved the mocktail being served here. Streaks are also quite tasty."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"CUT is on the playing field with the top tier of steakhouses in the world, offering top cuts of beef imported from the leading beef nations including waygu beef from Japan.The menu and the atmosphere were certainly more of what I would expect in a West Coast or Las Vegas steakhouse (no surprise)--contemporary, minimalist furnishing and decor.  Small plates with a modern cuisine flair, like shrimp cocktail with a wasabi panna cotta and delicate yuzu sauce.  The US Angus filet I had was absolutely spot on and delicious.The wine list had a pretty good range in the by-the-glass selection and the bar had a good variety of cocktails--classic and innovative both.Stylistically I prefer the 'old school' New York/Chicago style steakhouses (this I would not categorize as ""Traditional American Restaurants"")--where the emphasis is on the excellence of the ingredients and mastery of basic dishes that compliment the centerpiece of the meal.  So while I enjoyed my experience, the match goes to other team--particularly when one considers that this player has a bigger paycheck than who it's up against."
Steakhouses,CUT,-1,"Don't get me wrong, this is a great restaurant BUT I would never recommend it to anyone as it is massively over priced. The food is excellent and the service quite good. I had the pork belly as a starter and it was melt-in-the-mouth perfection. My husband and I shared the porterhouse which was delicious and perfectly cooked. The onion rings are excellent as well, exactly the way you always hope they'll be but rarely are. I had the S'mores for dessert and loved them. The wine menu is seriously extensive as is the cocktail menu. I loved the music but not sure that the Ramones would be to every diner's liking...But $900 for dinner for two at a steak house is far too much in my opinion. The mark-up on wine is huge. I just can't justify the cost."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"The exterior of the restaurant was intimidating but thankfully I had the courage to walk in and order a drink at the bar. Because, it proved to be one of the best decisions of my life (sorry for the exaggeration).The bar menu was reasonable in price (not as crazy and costly as the fine dining menu ). And, they give you a free bowl of gourmet popcorn. And when they say gourmet, they mean gourmet. Their popcorn was cooked in bacon fat and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.I am not much of a drinker and am completely uneducated in topics such as wine and rich-sounding cocktail concoctions. The super friendly staff politely offered their honest suggestions and I ended up with a drink called Dying Love (I may be mistaken but sounds like it). The drink was visually gorgeous - a raspberry resting on a slab of ice, floating on a pink sea. Similar to the movies Titanic and Life of Pi.From the bar menu, I ordered the mini steak burgers, 4 small ones on a cute white plate. While they are small, trust me, they are enough to fill you up. As an added bonus, they use the same high end steak they serve from the more expensive fine dining menu. So, it's a more affordable way of tasting their steak without spending 100 dollars.All in all, Cut is one of the most gorgeous and stylish restaurants I've been to. I have yet to try their fine dining area. But from my initial experience at the bar, I am sure I won't be disappointed when that time comes."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"Beyond being the best steak restaurant in Singapore, CUT won my heart forever when manager Glynn came to my rescue during a whisky and food tasting event that took place early in my pregnancy.As it was just only 2 months into my first trimester at the time, I was still holding off on telling my colleagues, happily ordering mocktails on the sly.  With high end whisky, the tastings were in small glasses and I pulled manager Glynn aside on my way to the ladies' room to explain my challenge.  Luckily, Glynn managed to subtly replace my whisky with tea (same color!) and I was unable to enjoy the evening stress-free.The food was exquisite as always.  My favorites included the bone marrow flan, the blue crab and shrimp ""Louis"", the pork belly, the steak and the pear crumble.PARTING THOUGHT: we're going back to celebrate getting to the second trimester!"
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"The place I go to for my Gin & Tonic fix just cause they make the best one around.As for the steak, I won't say it's out of the world kinda standard but it's decent with a hefty price tagged to it. Besides that, the souffle and the creamed spinach is a must-have when you're there.Regarding the ambiance, I find that the dining area is rather dark and probably due to how the restaurant is layout, the noise/sound bounces off the wall which kinda make the place really noisy/loud when people start chitter-chattering the night away (which make it hard to carry conversation properly). However, the bar area is just perfect. To be honest, I rather be sitting at the bar area to have my dinner than the dining area.(Nonetheless, I can't wait to head back there for rounds of G&T already.)"
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"I have not been to one of Wolfgang's CUT restaurants here in the states yet but loved going to business dinners at the one in Singapore at the Marina Bay Sands.  It is meatlovers heaven here.  Cool comfortable interiors, probably some of the best service in singapore (service isn't that good there generally but is changing).  American size portions, great cocktails, side dishes, and the desserts!  The management is american so they hold to their U.S. standard on the aged beef.  The meat trolly is uncommon in singapore so it was nice to see its appearance here.  You can't go wrong with CUT but warning it is pricey....have someone treat you there for maximum enjoyment :)  BTW - DB's, Mozza and Osteria across from it are all also equally great!  Rumor is that Thomas Keller is coming to Singapore soon at Marina Bay Sands.  BTW- dress in singapore is one notch down - so where here you would be expected to probably have a jacket on and the ladies dressed to the nines....in singapore it is much more casual which makes the singapore location an even more casual atmosphere for steak house beginners."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"Awesomeness !! This review is overdue and I finally found time to write it.I visited the other CUT locations as well and am a regular here at CUT Singapore, in particular the one in Beverly Hills. I found the whole setup and service here in Singapore much warmer and more pleasant with better service as well. If you are used to cold shoulder service, think again and visit CUT!The seating was nice and a short notice table was not a problem though not sure that is because my name popped up in their computer. The staff was and is always polite, professional and naturally friendly. A 5* experience. Note that it is a pricey experience as well though, think 350-400$ for a two person meal. But worth it!!!You will be presented with the various options of meat and the server explains to you what the specifics of the meat are.I personally like the 'Bone in Filet Mignon' medium rare paired with a nice red wine. This time we chose an Argentinian Malbec, a pleasure to drink. Note that I'm not even pretending to be a wine expert at all - I just like to drink what tastes well (to me) and so far Argentinian wines did not disappoint me in any way. The young lady who presented the wine was super friendly as always.The steak came, together with the sides which this time consisted of mushrooms and spinach.The highlight ladies and gentlemen is the dessert. Have the chocolate souffle and you with either foodgasm or die and go to heaven (or a combination of both) right at the table.So if you are looking for your perfect dining experience, come here and you won't regret it!Enjoy ~S."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"I don't eat steak often, mostly because almost all of my beef experiences in Singapore have been disappointing. I was pleasantly surprised, though, when I was dragged to Cut. I got the USDA New York sirloin with Argentinean Chimichurri sauce, potato puree, and creamed spinach. The sides were exactly what I expected. No surprises there, but archetypes of a high-end steak restaurant. The steak was what surprised me. Perfectly medium-rare, tender, with a smoky, crispy sear. I felt like I was in Chicago. Sure $88++ is not cheap for a 12oz. steak, but considering the market, it's a good deal. I've had some terrible steaks for not a lot less."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"The beef steak at cut totally blew my mind. I don't even like steak that much and I never had a craving for steak before. But my experience at cut have changed this! The cocktails were absolutely amazing too. All prepared beautifully, tasted great and packed a nice punch! I would totally come back here just for a drink next time.The down side of this restaurant would be their steep prices but the location, food and drinks here do justify it."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"Came here for a birthday dinner and it definitely lived up to expectations and beyond.  Excellent food, service and ambience.  We got a private table but was able to people watch in the middle of restaurant.  A simple menus with steak and steak, plenty of choices on sauces and sides.  Each staff was perfect in carrying out their services and they were professional to the nth degree.Dessert must try is the apple crumble.  The s'mores was slightly disappointing.  Otherwise a very perfect dinner as a dinner date or a party."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"The food was AMAZING!  We loved everything we had there.  We had salads, soups, filets, and sides...and everything was excellent!   Also the bartender,  Loogie, made me a mix drink that was out of this world!  It was literally the best drink I have ever had.....it was as big as my head, had an island of ice that had a live flower on top!!!  I'm in love :)"
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"CUT holds up with the best steakhouses I've been to in the USA, Australia, and Europe. We started our meal with the bone marrow flan. It was fantastic - it was rich and buttery. The garnish went perfectly with the marrow on top of a nice piece of toast. I was impressed. Additionally, the complimentary selection of breads, rolls, and breadsticks were all pretty impressive - it's hard not to fill up on them, but you should resist.For our main, I split the porterhouse for two. Not cheap ($178 if I recall), but between two it's actually one of the cheaper menu options. They carve the steak table side, which is a nice touch, and it is served with an assortment of complimentary sauces and mustards. The flavor of the steak itself was fantastic and exactly what you would expect from dry aged meat. The steak had a fantastic crust and flavor from the garnish of thyme, butter, and garlic. The meat was amazingly tender and nearly collapsed with each bite.For sides we had the onion rings and broccolini. Both were delicious and perfect accompaniments for a steak dinner. However, they obviously were not the most memorable parts of the meal.Service was truly fantastic here. Any request or order we had was met almost immediately. Even our order of onion rings came out a little late (maybe 5-10 minutes after the rest of our order) and they gave it to us on the house. Overall the meal was pricey, but by comparison to other restaurants in Singapore and taking into account the quality of the food and service, I didn't feel overcharged."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"Fantastic food, cocktails and service!We had chips and mini burgers in the lounge area, and two cocktails each, followed up by the chocolate soufflé. The chips were wonderful, my husband loved the sliders (I didn't try them, since I'm vegetarian) and the cocktails were delicious. The true hero of the meal though was the soufflé. It was delivered with a flourish and an explanation and it was wonderful.The service from the bar staff was fantastic. They were attentive without being suffocating, and they were good at making suggestions. Highly recommended."
Steakhouses,CUT,-1,"My brother warned me into coming to this restaurant. He went CUT in LA before and he said it was an underwhelming experience. The steaks were too 'modern' and even a bit pretentious. But I still want to try a modern steak house, and I haven't been to a Wolfgang Puck restaurant before so curiosity got the best of me.The appetizers were alright. I've tried the oysters, pork belly, warm veal tongue, and they were all very decent.But the steak that I ordered was an extremely huge letdown. I've tried and fell in love with Snake River Farms beef before when I was in the US. Theoretically, what the breeder seek to accomplish is marry that wonderful beefiness of American beef, with the luxurious marbling of Japanese beef.I was ecstatic when I discovered that they were gonna serve that beef in CUT Singapore. Even before flying off to Singapore, I already knew what I was gonna have for my steak.My favorite cut of the meat is the rib eye, particularly because of that fat, decadent layer up top known as the rib cap. When my Snake River Farms rib eye came, I was shocked with horror. It came WITHOUT the rib cap. I thought I was just unlucky, and during my 2nd visit, I ordered the same thing, only to face the same nightmare for the second time. -_-The rib eye itself was not that good too. It was too dry, and too chewy and was a great injustice to a Snake River Farms beef.I don't think I'll be back to CUT ever again. There are many better steak houses in Singapore and I'd rather go to Ruth Chris' or even Morton's instead."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"OK, I'm a Ruth's Chris and Mastros (SC Plaza) bigot when it comes to steaks, but I gotta say, CUT is now in my top 3 steakhouses.   First of all, the service is fantastic.  Two, the drinks are FANTASTIC -- best dirty martini I've ever had in Singapore.  Third, my steak and the extra cheesy mac and cheese along with the tuna tartar appetizer were ""lick the plate clean"" good.I also met some of the nicest people the night I ate at the bar - from NYC, Houston and NJ.   This place is classy so I recommend business casual attire.  They also had a great selection of wines and I had a Spanish red wine (can't remember the name) that was  fantastic."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"I-went-back-so-new-review:still utterly fantastic, and wonderfully enjoyable dessert at the marina bay sands. it is understating it to say that this place is now my favorite in singapore - and no, I've not had their steak, and no, I'm not quite planning to. I have an incorrigible sweet tooth, and it aches for this behemoth of a chocolate souffle. their other desserts are pretty much up there with the best I've had locally, but it's the souffle that shines - there's some magic in the substantial lightness, and all the textures and temperatures in it. I could wax lyrical all day (and I've done it once before), but really, just look at it - chocolate sauce dribbling down the side while creme fraiche and ice cream sink their slow way into that airy nest of chocolate.but you've heard me say all this before - so I'll try to spare you further expostulation. suffice to say that the standard's consistent, the chocolate deep and satisfying - well worth any gym-rat behavior. we also managed two other desserts this time - a deconstructed banana cream pie of creme brulee, chocolate pearls and a caramel banana ice cream; and a chocolate hazelnut marjolaine cake with caramel popcorn and salted popcorn ice cream.both were pretty good - and I especially liked the the chocolate-hazelnut slice (though I might be biased as a newtella addict), though the accompanying popcorn seemed a little staleish. small detail though - we lapped everything up. the place is dark and intimate, service friendly and efficient - and really, the prices aren't low but I'm more than happy to spend it here for the quality and portions. most definitely my favorite place here. ----------------------------------------------old review:utterly fantastic and wholly incomparable bliss-out desserts at this famed steakhouse in marina bay sands. I have unashamedly fallen in deep mire with this place - it's now my go-to for indulging in sweets, and I'm afraid that it might just become an uncontrollable habit.I've wanted to come here for a long time - and while I'm bursting with adjectives, let me objectively say that the souffle was high, fluffy, barely deflated even after standing, and when eaten with the chocolate ice cream and creme fraiche on top - was a revelation in deep dark chocolate and that gorgeous play of hot and cold. truly, this ranks as one of the best mouthfuls I've ever had."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"Steak in Singapore, why not!  And why not go to CUT for that consistency that we come to expect from Wolfgang Puck restaurant.  What a brilliant night at CUT I had last weekend.  Was traveling solo and had a few meals at local establishments and decided to go visit CUT - this is my third experience at a CUT restaurant (Las Vegas and London being the other two) and I could not find one thing wrong - everything surpassed my expectations.  From the excellent seating at the bar, to the attention I received from the bartender, the cocktail waitress to the GM himself, the service was over-the-top.  And the food?  Amazing appetizers and I did get a chance to try a few of them.  The Scallops were divine.  The dirty martini was everything I had heard - my best one at a bar.  The steak (had the filet) was cooked perfect and would rival any steak you'd get in the US.  The wine pairing was perfect as was the final cap on the experience - a Singaporean version of baked Alaska.  They had to roll me out of the restaurant, but at least I had a big smile on my face.  Lastly, I don't normally cast judgement on others, but I do find it funny that people constantly comment on how pricey restaurants are.  If you do your homework (and it would not be hard in this case) you'll know the general price for a meal.  This place is expensive.  I reserve going to CUT when I'm in the mood to splurge and have a great time.  I actually don't even look at the price as I know it's going to cost a lot.  Is it worth it, absolutely!  Is it for anyone, no!  Just know that if you are willing to spend it, you will have an excellent night out - I did and have not regretted one visit to CUT."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"Very good steak and ambience is nice - a bit dark, but modern and stylish.Dinner is pricey - expect to pay about 150-200 per person when all is said and done. I prefer Morton's to Cut"
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"5-star food at 5-star pricesSingaporeans are passionate about their steaks. It's not uncommon to find $100 steaks on the menus of many high-end restaurants. At Cut though, the prices go significantly higher when you throw in the tempting array of appetisers, sides and mains - which are done well, if you need to justify the bill. A hearty dinner for two with wine will reach past $500 easily.When you're mulling over the menu, the waiter will trundle over a meat trolley filled with American cuts in white napkins and Japanese cuts in black. The service is absolutely impressive - if you are familiar with Morton's you'll know what I mean.For wagyu lovers and first timers, I highly recommend the Tasting of New York Sirloin - it includes Kobe style from Snake River Farm (120g), USDA Prime corn-fed (120g), and Japanese wagyu from Shiga (60g). As you can guess, these are pretty tender and marbled choices, so if you prefer something more robust, try the Angus ribeye or such. It's a real meat market here with just about something to suit everyone. Wolfgang Puck pops by to Singapore about once a year. so don't expect to see the man himself - instead, he's got a whole crew of stellar managers and chefs from the US to oversee this jumpin' joint. The music's rather loud but we're told it's the way they like it in the States."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,a little pricey but simple and straightforward dining. all items are great but I loved the chocolate soufflé in particular - really because it's quite hard to find good soufflé in Singapore.service is a real performance.
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"Being a vegetarian, I will admit that I have only ever been to the lounge area at CUT. But I feel no shame in reviewing the place despite my clearly ""incomplete"" experience, because it is just that good.What can I tell you about the cocktails here? I don't want to recommend a specific one... I'm sure your tastes differ from mine. But I will say that they are all intricately prepared and most of them will blow your mind. Should I talk about the Rough Love, a combination of gin, umeshu and champagne, is served in a large wine glass, with a giant cube of ice. A single raspberry sits atop that ice cube, and remains there until you finish your drink. The drink looks like an expensive pink diamond ring. A delicate balancing act, both taste wise and architecturally. Or should I tell you about the time my hubby asked them to make a penicillin, and I sneaked a peek of the bartender pouring Domaine de Canton in the drink? ""It's not going to be the same.."" I muttered under my breath, disgruntled. It wasn't... but it was amazing. Or should I mention that they barrel age some of their cocktails? The negroni that I ended up with was softened and rounded off having spent some time in the cask, and it tasted timeless. I guess I could go on and on. The main reason to recommend the lounge at CUT is the fact that their bartenders are great artists, and they have a great passion for the art of making good cocktails. And if you ever do go, don't forget to order a portion of the butterscotch apple dessert -- it's the bomb.Singapore has many cocktail bars, but a few great ones. I count the bar at CUT and the one at Tippling club as the only ones to understand truly what it is like to create a balanced cocktail, time and time again."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"Coming to CUT was definitely a good choice when I went to Singapore, the steak was delicious and perfectly cooked. If you want to get steak while your abroad in Singapore, this is the place."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"This was dinner for NYE 2014.  Or is it 2015?  Either way, the food was expensive.  We knew what we were getting ourselves into.  Marina Bay Sands, and what not.  Suffice to say, no one was disappointed despite the cost.  My Manhattan had to have been the best damn Manhattan I have ever had. The wine list was extensive and, at the same time, downright ludicrous.  The lamb with mint sauce was cooked to perfection.  Ahi tartare was executed properly enough.  I don't know if this is where I would recommend someone to go in Singapore for a nice meal, but it did the trick.  They could do without the creepy framed pics of celebrities on the walls.  We spent several minutes trying to identify Katy Perry.  She looks like Zooey Deschanel, and I was thinking Marion Cotillard..."
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"There was a point in my life when I visited CUT monthly, because it was SOOOO GOOD. Everything from the little cheese poppers (in lieu of bread), right down to the impeccable service, this place is a dream to dine at! Try the lobsters! It is surprisingly delish. They also slice up the lobsters with deft, orchestrated simultaneous strokes. Dessert is also a do. Yum yum yum!!!"
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"When in Singapore, I love the food here.  I don't question the quality...it always tastes fresh and lives up to its expectations.  The irony is, I'm not a fan of steak.  And either is my usual dining mate (who is vegetarian).  So we order salads and ""on the side"" dishes in droves and feast in that style for the evening.  The waitstaff has always been wonderful; sometimes we eat at the bar and chat it up with fellow patrons or the bartender.  Great ambiance.  Look forward to coming back again!"
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"frequented Mozza and DB Bistro but somehow avoided the steak house across because I've never had a good slab of steak here in Singapore... until I ventured into Cut. We started with the appetizer of bone marrow flan, it was creamy and flavorful and please do share it. No one should eat this entire dish alone. We also shared the steak tartare which was also fantastic but the serving was good for two. So two appetizers for two pax was too much. We ordered the US Wagyu Ribeye and the seasoning, texture, and doneness were perfect. I was blown away. I tried the different sauces they provided which were good but I prefer it without any sauces. We thought of ordering a side dish but wanted to save space for dessert.For dessert, we shared the souffle and it was the perfect exclamation point to a delicious dinner!"
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"I have not been to Cut for a proper meal but have been for drinks and dessert. Located in Marina Bay Sands, the restaurant is posh and one of the celebrity restaurants at MBS. Cocktails here are amazing. One of the best places to get cocktails here in Singapore. Its not cheap, but they do not skimp on alcohol here at all. The concotions are very interesting and sophisticated. Dessert here is very good as well. We tried the chocolate soufflé which was amazing. A nice place to go for a chill night of drinks."
Steakhouses,CUT,-1,"Prices are ridiculous, especially for mediocre food that every other restaurant is doing. Where's the innovation?"
Steakhouses,CUT,1,Expensive but great meat selection n good appetisers too. Order their pork belly n mac n cheese. Highly recommended!
Steakhouses,CUT,1,"Great venue (too bad it's in a mall, albeit a very fancy one), the bar has good scene, the service is fantastic, and the steaks are just the best in Singapore.  Hands down!  Pricey, but not much more than other steakhouses in the city.  But unlike other steakhouses, here the quality of the meat is fantastic."
Noodles,Depot Road Zhen Shan Mei Claypot Laksa,1,"This is one of my favourite laksas in Singapore. The gravy is really lemak and is properly spicy, the way I like it. The claypot also adds a little extra oomph to the taste/overall laksa eating experience. The drawbacks are that the portion sizes are a bit small - I usually order medium - and they are a little stingy with ingredients. But maybe this is because I'm comparing the current standard to when the stall was still run by the father at the Depot Road location. I personally feel that the standard has dropped a bit since then. The other problem is that the parking is a little problematic at Bukit Merah as there are very few lots near the market. However, these are small complaints for me at the end of the day. I've still found myself coming back for more because this laksa really is that good."
Noodles,Depot Road Zhen Shan Mei Claypot Laksa,-1,"Nice and spicy laksa.  The soup itself is very tasty and spicy.  However, could use more stuff in the laksa.  More tofu? More shrimp?  Something to give it more texture, depth?"
Noodles,Depot Road Zhen Shan Mei Claypot Laksa,1,Nice clay pot laksa but the standard is not as good as it used to be when the stall location was in depot road.
Noodles,Depot Road Zhen Shan Mei Claypot Laksa,1,"I'm not the hugest fan of laksa mainly because I'm terrible at tolerating spicy food, but when something's good, I've just got to eat it, which explains my foray to katong for laksa from time to time. That was before I discovered Zhen Shan Mei, which is located much nearer to where I live. I used to get my convenient fix of laksa sitting on the stools inside Queensway Shopping Centre, in between a casual stroll looking around for sporty stuff. Now, a five minute walk across to Alexandra Village brings me to one of the most 'sedap' bowls of laksa you'll find in Singapore.Some may not like it this way, but I adore this because it's so thick, rich and a fairly oily, so it not only leaves me quite full, but also satisfied to last till my next craving. It always feels good to eat out of a claypot, so there's that factor to this too, but I believe it's the way it's warmed in claypots that brings out that flavour in the soup. I wouldn't note this for its spiciness, because I don't recall having that big a sweat eating this, but even if you crave the chilli you will surely still enjoy this! Just ask for added chilli on the side, perhaps."
Asian Fusion,Empress,1,"Been here twice for dim sums in the weekends, and both times I have been impressed by everything!  The good is good, the service is attentive, the venue and location are great, and all of this for half of the price of brunch at any PS Cafes! :-)Will continue to come back here!"
Asian Fusion,Empress,1,"We went to a large corporate dinner, so we didn't choose what we ate, but dishes ranged from above average to very good. The main assets of the place are the superb view of Boat Quay, and the excellent service from a friendly and efficient team."
Asian Fusion,Empress,1,"Excellent quality pricy dishes beautiful viewsIt opened only for a month but the crowd on a Saturday is quite surprising, not busy but buzzing. Causually dressed in a business district, and quiet conversations happens in the background. The views of the river and skyline across is mesmerising. At 6.30pm we get some orange tinge across the cityscape. Nice. Probably more romantic then it was. The food is just as excellent. Dim sum and cantonese dishes in upclass setting by the river. Tri platter roast tops our expectation while the sweet sour soup was delicious, right amount of spicy and sour for Asian palate. The stir fried pork cooked right with texture soft and chewy. We like the mushrooms too. The scallop on asparagus is lightly fried and the sweetness comes thru with the first bite. Our lobster noodles came last to fill the stomach and it taste as good as it looks. Eating the lobster requires is a handful but the tender noodles is a bit bland considering all the flavourful dishes upfront. On the whole the experience is very pleasant though pricy. Will return for special occasions."
Asian Fusion,Empress,1,Decent food and drinks with a nice view along the river. Reasonably priced especially in comparison to its  nearby competitors.
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"Great lunch spot. Just order one of the two waygu dons and that is more than enough food to satisfy a wagyu don craving.Love sitting at the bar and watching the chef book your food on the grill.Unfortunately I got suckered by the waiter into ordering a few sides because he said the waygu don is a small portion (it was more than enough). So ended up wasting untouched mushrooms and shishito peppers.Prices are as crazy as they've been since I started coming here some 2 years ago. Don't order sushi here even though they call is high quality. My orders of king salmon and large scallop were both just awful.Location is very awkward, attached to a general hospital. You have patients coming out in wheelchairs attached to an ivy drop and here we come out of an Mercedes Uber to eat at a steakhouse.  Definitely worth checking out."
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,-1,Great set lunch deal. Walked out belly full. Wagyu steak was good. Though a couple of slices were a tad sinewy. But the rice below was so good.
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"Really good food, despite the odd location at a medical centre. Had the wagyu donburi set - beef was really nicely seared but juicy on the inside, onsen egg was perfectly cooked, the black truffle was a nice touch. Service was friendly and efficient. Make a reservation, as it's pretty full for lunch. Only taking a star off for the location and the prices."
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,-1,The standard of the food here dropped tremendously from the last time I've been here. I usually enjoy my steak w. a tinge of salt and that will be perfect. But the steak here is not as good as I remembered. The taste was blend and dissatisfying; I had to drown it in the ginger sauce to give it a taste.
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"The fois nigiri is simply my favorite bite of food at Uchi, and perhaps in the world, so when I saw fois donburi on the menu at the Fat Cow I knew where I was going to eat. I was only in Singapore for 2 days, and they are closed on Sunday, so Monday lunch was my only opportunity. Thankfully they had the fois donburi as a lunch set item. My hotel is right around the corner, so for me this was a convenient location, but it's about 10-15 mins away from the CBD. Singapore isn't very big and I was actually coming from the CBD doing touristy things, so I can assure you it's worth the $7 cab ride (even less in USD). This restaurant is oddly located in a medical center, so don't worry about the heart arrack options, you're in good hands with Singapore's healthcare system."
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"Fat cow is definitely a place to try. The place may be a bit difficult locate (ok at least it was for me because I was not acquainted with Camden Medical center before that), but it was worth the long walk (we walked from Ion - took about 15min). The place was pretty packed when we went at 1300hrs for lunch, and because we didn't make reservations, we were asked to come back at 1400hrs (SO, DO CALL IN BEFORE DROPPING BY!). We both had the set lunch (ranges from about $35-$50), which is quite reasonable for such a pricy place. It comes with soup, chowaimushi, salad, and the entrée. Let's just say that I experience heaven when I first ate the wagyu don. The meat was nice and tender, and I love the sauce on the rice so much I ate everything - that's a big deal because I'm not a great fan of rice!I was also pleased to see that they had an extensive selection of Umeshu. On the rocks is the best way to go! :)"
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"Very good in food, service, environment. Not difficult to make reservation. The only thing makes me rate it only 4 stars is not professional in details. The A5 beef is served in low temperature, which impacts the overall taste. Not very impressive, but good enough!"
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,-1,"Last time this is my favorit place to have lunch, donburi  rice is nice. The beef so tender n juicy, foigrass so nice ,but I feel nowadays the quality of taste abit different."
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,Extremely nice restaurant. The steak was devine!!!!! The prices are steep but worth it if you are a true meat lover. Nice decor & ambiance.Agree its a bit difficult to locate if you are not familiar with the area.
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"Before I walked into Fat Cow, I was expecting a very small portion with huge prices. This was far from the truth. They actually had many cheaper options on the menu and they are JUST as good as the more expensive options.""Then what sets them apart?"", you say?Well... you get EXACTLY what you pay for -  you can order a whole steak... with a side of that delicious japanese rice with egg or you can spend 35 -40ish with cubed wagyu with rice and an egg in a claypot. BOTH were good!Down here.. you can still decide if you wanna splash out the cash or still have a very decent meal at a decent price.I've heard tht this was a place for beef so of course I went for the 40 day aged wagyu with a side of rice, onsen egg and ordered m'self some foie gras! It was my birthday weekend anyways! :)My friends ordered the claypot beef rice thingie and another had the wagyu steak and a side of beef tartar. Both very yummy indeed!Being a major beef lover, I'm the kind that either hardly eats any beef if it isn't good but if I DO have a beef craving, i'm going to make sure its a good cut and mostly costs over $40 anyways.You can be sure I'll be putting this little gem in my pocket of ""places-to-go-for-good-beef""!BTW... I heard the lunch specials here are very affordable and worth it! Those who have that extra free time or don't have to work like the rest of us, well don't say I didn't mention it! You can thank me later! :)4.8 STARS"
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,-1,"Foie and wagyu is pretty expensive and its hard to get in NorCal. California banned foie gras for a couple of years and then allow foie lovers to consume this rich protein early 2015. Thanks being said, when I see a restaurant serving two of my top 5 favorite proteins, I'm on a mission to clog my arteries. Ordered the fat foie and wagyu donburi bowl and the truffle sea bream sashimi.The truffle sea bream sashimi was good but not fantastic. They put too much truffle oil and ponzu that overpowers the fish. As for the donburi bowl. I'm happy that they gave a 1:1 foie/wagyu portion but was sad that the wagyu lack the natural beef flavor bc it was season with some garlic soy. The beef was cooked nicely and it passed as a filet.Overall, service was on point but food was mediocre."
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"There are great restaurants and there are MEMORABLE restaurants. Fat Cow is one of those memorable restaurants that you will talk about for a very a long time. I brought my wife here for our 2nd year wedding anniversary based on the glowing reviews on yelp.The Food was good, that's an understatement. The Ambience was sexy and dark, that's an understatement. The rice, yes I segregate rice from food because in my world rice reigns supreme, was sublime, that's an understatement.When you come to Fat Cow, there are two dishes you MUST order: the Wagyu steak (pick any grade, they are all out of this world) and the Fat Rice. The Wagyu at Fat Cow unlike any steak I've ever tried. It has the tenderness of a tenderloin yet the juicy taste of Ribeye. However, the pride and joy of Fat Cow is the PHAT Rice. ;-)  Perfectly cooked high grade Japanese rice layered with the oil drippings of the very Wagyu just prepared for you a few minutes prior.  Holy smokes!!!To tell you the truth, I started my dinner with the Fat Cow Donburi - Wagyu Beef with Onsen egg and shiro negi. However, as soon as I saw my wife's Wagyu place across from with the fat rice arriving soon thereafter, I immediately had buyers remorse. I ate my Donburi as I fast can, which was good, but no where near the quality of the Wagyu dish sitting across from me. As soon as I was done, I ordered exactly what my wife ordered and I had no regrets!This dinner was truly special in more ways than one. However, for me to judge Fat Cow purely on its merits, I would consider it among the very best dining experiences I have ever had.  Did I mention we also had Australian Pinot Noir to accompany our fabulous dinner. :-)"
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"Great place for Japanese-style steaks, shabu-shabu and sukiyaki. The appetizers and desserts are also awesome. If you have the Entertainer application you can get main courses one-for-one which is a great deal."
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"Fat Cow, oh Fat Cow, can you please be less delish so that I would not turn into a fat cow myself?The lunch deal is an amazing deal for the budget-conscious. Perfectly Charcoal-grilled wagyu with a perfect onsen egg - mix it all in over Japanese rice and your meal is complete. The set also comes with chawanmushi (not the best I've had, but you are not here for this), a salad, miso soup, and ends with a daily dessert. The day that I was there, it was an amazing honeycomb ice-cream that still has pieces of honeycomb in it. Perfect for the recent hot weather. All these for under s$40.This is only a review for lunch and I can't wait to go for dinner, or another lunch, or another whatever at Fat Cow.Reservation is a must!"
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"I'm not on here to talk about how awesome all the cows served in the restaurant (because hands down, everyone knows it's spectacular) but on the side dishes and a drink instead. At first, I ordered the Phat Rice aka Fat Rice, that costs $8 because of all the reviews I read, but oh man, I was hugely disappointed. It's just like regular gohan with a few drops of soy sauce that the restaurant claims to be some legit oil (in fact, it's just like a plain gohan to be honest).I was hugely amazed by the glistening and gorgeous-looking Zosui rice though! I knew it, from the moment I saw it on the menu book that it would be such an incredibly astonishing meal. For those of you who wonder what the heck is Zosui, well, according to an encyclopedia, Z?sui is a Japanese rice soup made from pre-cooked rice and water. BUT! Instead of water, the Zosui in Fat cow is made of AUTHENTIC BEEF AND MUSHROOM BROTH! Can you imagine??! No? Okay, go try it yourself then. :DFor the drinks, my partner and I ordered a light alcohol drink with peach and lychee flavor, on the rock. The alcohol content was just nice for an early dinner, tastes slightly sweeter than Umeshu but I love it. The only disappointing thing was the amount served, just way too little. :(Service and interior wise, it was wonderful!"
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"Wow. Was I impressed. Not only does this restaurant offer A5 wgayu from Japan and beef bowls, they also serve delicious sashimi and sushi.We ordered the set lunch which is a great deal and a lot cheaper than the regular menu.The menu also offers different cuts of cow (hence the name) as well as Australian and Japanese wgayu, American beef, shabu shabu.. etc... The set lunch comes with appetizers- salad, miso soup, and egg custard pudding. All yummy. The egg had shrimp and mushroom in it, and it tastes just like the ones in Japan.Sushi Moriawase, 46Chef's choice of 10 premium sushiI did not expect this to be amazing.. but boy was I wrong. There was toro, salmon, scallops, hamachi, red snapper (last three not sure) and salmon roe. The toro melted in your mouth.. and all the fishes were super tender and fresh. The salmon also melted in your mouth which was unexpected because its salmon... ugh I loved this plate.The Fat Cow Donburi, 38Charcoal grilled wgayu beef with onset egg & shiro negi- wow. for some reason they failed to mention there was truffle on it. like why would you omit that from the menu? Nice surprise, and damn was the meat cooked perfectly and extremely tender and flavorful. Fat Foa-Gura Don, 45Glazed foie gras and grilled wgayu beef over rice. omg. everything about this bowl was perfect. added a poached egg on the side, but it wasn't necessary. The sauce on the meats were already enough and so so good.. and the rice with the sauce was great as well. This bowl was .... perfect. I was already full from the sushi but I couldn't stop eating because it was that good.. Also had red radishes (I think) on the side to go along with it.You would think a restaurant not focusing on any type of food and having all these different types of Japanese food would decrease its quality and taste, but not this one. Everything was top notch and extremely yummy. When I'm back in Singapore, you will most definitely find me here."
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,Went on a Saturday while I was in town and enjoyed an amazing set menu meal. I had the Wagyu Beef with a soft egg/ Wagyu Nigiri/ Shishito Peppers/ and a few other appetizers. Absolutely great service and atmosphere. The food was delicious and priced reasonably considering the quality. I went for lunch on a Saturday and I recommend getting a reservation. I'll be back next time I'm in Singapore.
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"Its hard to find a better experience than this. Food and service were awesome. If you're looking for a japanese inspired steak house, THIS IS IT! Bar none. You gotta try it."
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"There have been mixed reviews on the restaurant and one thing I heard was that the food doesn't justify the price. However, with the downward revision of the already affordable lunch sets, I don't think anyone would be deterred from checking FC out. Each set comes with salad, chawanmushi, miso soup and dessert with your choice of mains. Pick from the 12 mains which are priced from $25 to $48. Don't worry if you're not a beef fan, there are sashimi, pork and chicken on the menu too.The chawanmushi was topped with a light tasting crab sauce and it has prawn, mushroom and scallop in it.We ordered the Kinoko ($14), assorted Japanese mushrooms braised with sake, lime and butter. Honestly, it tasted like normal stir fry with a tinge of lime. A disappointment really. And it was a rather small portion.We also tried the Nasu Dengaku ($10), barbecued eggplant glazed with honey miso. This is a tiny baby Japanese eggplant and it certainly isn't worth the price tag. There was a plum undertone in the salty miso which didn't sit well with the girls.We had the 2 hot favorites at Fat Cow, which is the Fat Foa-Gura Don ($42) and The Fat Cow Donburi ($38). It was a tussle between the 2 choices but here's the flavor profiles so that you can decide for yourself! The Fat Foa-Gura Don has the rich and buttery glazed foie gras chunks and grilled wagyu beef cubes. The sauce was a little on the sweet side but the overall flavor is strong and heavy. I liked the toppings on this one but i found the rice to be a little on the dry side and it acted like a sponge, soaking up all the oil from the goose liver..The Fat Cow Donburi is a simpler dish in comparison but it has its own merits. Charcoal grilled Wagyu Beef with a light garlic flavor, with onsen egg and shiro negi. The first thing we noticed about the dish was its truffle aroma.Break the egg and mix everything together and enjoy the moist and flavorful rice. Absolutely delicious."
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"This is another amazingly beautiful room.  The 3D wooden matrix celling is nothing short of beautiful.Link to external source for interior photo:tinyurl.com/8fujph3Along with the beautiful room, the conservative Japanese influenced service was excellent.  The servers were consistently insuring the meal was moving forward.  They were each very professional and polite.My friend does not drink sake.  She selected a cocktail called the Unusual.  Unfortunately, I can't remember what she thought of this cocktail.With a little input from the server, I decided on a sake for myself.  After selecting my glass from the tray offered, I tried the sake  (DASSAI JUNMAI DAIGINJO) and was quite pleased.  I tend to lean more towards sake with a profile featuring slight touches of fruit.The food ranged from good to very good.  Honestly, I was expecting very good to excellent.   Some dishes flirted with this but I do not think they quite reached it.Sushi Mori - Featuring very high quality fish and strong preparation, this was a very enjoyable dish.tinyurl.com/9oq7ey4Truffle Fries - These were also very good.  I could certainly taste the truffle.  Plus, the fries had a very nice crispiness.tinyurl.com/8zyaa8uZuchini Blossom Tempura - This was one of the highlights of the meal.  The tempura blossoms were stuffed with Hokkaido scallops.  It was a delicate and subtle dish.  The presentation was very impressive.tinyurl.com/8mjcsyrWagyu Ox Tendon & Foie Gras - I did not try this dish.  I have made a personal choice not to eat foie gras.  My friend said it was good but not great.  She grew a little tired of the tendon.tinyurl.com/9rqmwxySnake River Farms US Wagyu Steak - This was good.  it was cooked perfectly.  However, I thought the cut was a little on the small side.  Plus, it was a bit bland.  It is possible that it was not properly rested before slicing.tinyurl.com/9zzsq7bShabu Shabu with Grade 3 Japanese Beef from the Kagoshima Prefecture - This was good.  The overall presentation was very nice.  I do think though that due to its nature, the depth of flavors of the meat in shabu shabu is limited.  Hence, the special sides for increasing the flavor.  My favorite part of the shabu shabu was actually the mushrooms.  They were divine.  tinyurl.com/99zxd4xOverall, this is a beautiful restaurant with truly excellent service.  I just thought the food fell ever so slightly short.  From a presentation standpoint, I thought it held up to any restaurant I've visited in the last year.  However, from a flavor standpoint, I thought it fell a tad short of some others.  When visiting restaurants of this caliber and expense, the expectations are very high."
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"Fat cow is for meat lovers. They have sea food and Sushi like any Japanese restaurant, But you don't go there for that. Besides there are other places, arguably better. No you come for the beef. Forget the fancy Japanese meat dishes and just go for the slab of steak. They have Japanese, Australian and US. Skip the rest and head for the Japanese to really sample authentic wagu cooked to perfection. Order medium rare at most. Anything more cooked is sacrilege. Side dishes are meager but very good. The stuffed zucchini flowers are excellent, as are the various salads. Order the smaller portion of meat. Your wallet and stomach will thank you. The high fat content will fill you if you take the time to savor each piece. This is not the time to wolfing down your meal. Chew more times than you normally do before swallowing to get the full experience.  A side dish of fat rice is the perfect accompaniment.  Be prepared to pay through your nose though, but for that special occasion, go for it."
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"Gourmet lunch on a budgetDining at Fat Cow can quickly burn a huge hole in your pocket, so if you're not looking to spend upwards of $250 on a meal, there're also the +/- $60 lunch sets. Us group of ladies decided on a Friday treat and managed to snag an inside table for 6. Most of us ordered the donburi despite the carbo threat - honestly, don't waste a single grain of the perfectly plump, chewy, sticky short-grain rice; it's that good. While 1 friend took the Hokkaido don (with seasonal seafood), 3 others ordered the Wagyu donburi with onsen egg while 2 of us went for the foie gras & wagyu donburi. The wagyu was everything you hope it would be - fat glistening cubes of meat that almost melted in the mouth with no resistance. I didn't expect the cubes of wagyu to be of such high quality - at least A3 if not higher.  The crisp pan-seared cubes of foie gras also had a nice smoky char that added to the fragrance of the bowl. I love my fatty (eg flavourful) meats, so this portion was perfect. Some thought it was a little too much but finished up anyway. The lunch set also includes miso soup, salad, a chawanmushi and dessert, all of an amazing quality that gives you a taste of the full fledged experience.Lunch sets available from Mon-Fri only, 12-3pm."
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"this was a great lunch! the decor is beautiful with a 3d wooden cube structure on the ceiling that elicited notes of traditional japan while still being contemporary.on to the grub:i ordered the wagyu beef cubes with foie gras donburi. the beef was slightly overcooked versus my order of medium rare, but the foie gras was cooked perfectly. the rice was a bit plain, some gravy would have been groovy. i tried my friend's wagyu with egg donburi and that was much better. the hamachi carpaccio with truffles was heavenly, although the taste was a bit heavy.the mushrooms were no bueno - flavors were too strong and too salty. we barely ate any of it.I also had one of the grilled prawns. it was quite nice, fresh and cooked perfectly.service:service was poor. my grilled prawn came after my dessert ice cream. really? also, i asked for a water refill and waited 15 minutes for them to top off my cup. there aren't even that many customers here, how can they be so slow?"
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,-1,If you are a vegetarian you have not a lot of options here. 4 veggie side dishes that are insanely expensive. I mean 3 slices of sweet potato for 12S$? Really?The vegetable tempura was not that good. I had better in cheaper places like Shin Kushiya. But the service was very good and very nice. Overall much to expensive for what you get.
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,-1,"After all the rave reviews on Yelp, I was really excited to try this place out for the awesome lunch. I like to visit atas restaurants for lunch first, and if the taste agrees, I will proceed to having dinner. I was super excited about this foie gras and wagyu beef rice bowl, and boy, did it disappoint. The first time it was served, it wasn't what I expected. I had asked for rare, and dark chunks of over-cooked beef and foie gras (meagre serving) was just not what I had hoped for. I sent it back and the second time, it was still slightly overcooked but I did not want to send it back the second time. The thing that really gets me was the lack of marinate/ flavor in the beef cubes. It tasted like it was just salty, with no umami whatsoever. Service was good, servers were very professional. For a meal that was $48++, I will not be coming back. The food just did not deliver."
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"Holy Fat Cow, what a mindblowing experience!That is all.Oh alright if you insist.Food : The zucchini blossom tempura stuffed with Hokkaido was delicious! Light and crisp yet extremely more-ish. Love. We also had the wagyu ox tendon pan seared foie gras and daikon ... the flavor was really brought out by the fact that it was slow cooked although I'm personally not a fan of ox tendon, and was nicely balanced by the daikon. We opted for shabu-shabu and charcoal grill, and was recommended the Japanese Grade A5 and the US Wagyu respectively. Both turned out absolutely mindblowingly out of this world delicious. We could have eaten the whole cow!Ambience : The people behind Fat Cow have taken over the premises that housed the former Le Figue and turned it into something chic and gorgeous.Service : Excellent although the attentiveness of the chefs became a bit unnerving after a while.Not for the fainthearted."
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"Their beef and foie gras bowl is worth every penny... Although every time I finish, I'm tempted to order another bowl."
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,-1,"Way overpriced for what you get, service is terrible and the place will be closed in less than a year.The menu is designed to deceive you. The waiter explains that the beef is priced per 100grams, but you have to pay for a minimum of 200 grams, and the chef weighs the piece that they have, so you have no idea what it is going to cost. We got a cut each of the Australian Wagyu and the US Wagyu for $360. Between four people that is a ridiculously small amount of beef for the price.Starters were the dumplings and the sashimi special for $120 and it is itty bitty portions. Now the food was delicious, but there is no way you can justify that price for some raw fish that would fit on the average side plate.The beef was decent, but it does not take that much experience to cook it medium. We popped a bottle of wine for $170 and that rounded out the whole overcharged experience.A couple of tips for the management:1. Charge less or serve more. Your menu is misleading, and I hate being ripped off.2. If your restaurant is empty, why were some menu items unavailable?3. Train your servers better. Every time I took a sip from my glass, the waiter refilled it. In addition, they hovered around our table watching us before ordering, and watching us eat. Majorly annoying when you are trying to enjoy yourself with friends.4. Change the name and the location, they are both stupid.5. Better yet, just close up. You are not offering an awesome enough experience for $160 per head"
Steakhouses,Fat Cow,1,"I love steaks. I am always on the look out for a nice slab of marbled meat. So far, Fat Cow's steak is the best I've ever tried. Being a big fan of steaks, I ordered the A5* wagyu steak, seared to medium rare.*A5 is the highest grade being awarded to wagyu beef. It is determined based on its marbling score, meat colour and brightness, firmness and texture of meat, and color/quality of fats.The steak was 300g and cost $298++. That comes up to more than $1/g and every mouthful that I took was probably worth $10 but it was so worth it! The divine taste of beef, fats that melted away without giving a greasy feeling, coupled with the grainy yet tender texture of the meat created the perfect steak ever. Every bite that I took, I went straight into heaven, lingered there for awhile, before coming back down for another bite. It was really that good. Of course, this was also the most expensive steak I've ever eaten so I was glad it measured up to expectations. The steak was served with a shoyu dip with grated ginger and sesame. Initially, I was skeptical about dipping such a marblellous piece of steak into shoyu but wow, the shoyu brought out the sweetness of the beef!!! We also asked for some freshly grated wasabi to pair with the beef because we liked that combination.We also ordered a few other dishes to share before the steak arrived. Traditional 'onsen-egg' served warm with a hunk of crispy fried beef bone marrow in a citrus dashiThe bone marrow was crispy and light with a tinge of sweetness while the citrus dashi added a refreshing taste. Break apart the yolk and you have a creamy balance of sweet and saltiness. A perfect appetiser!The zucchini stuffed with snow crab was amazing! The tempura was light and crispy yet not oily and there was a large amount of crab meat inside. The crab meat was fresh and sweet. We also had the choice of dipping it into mustard which excited our tastebuds. Overall, this was a unique dish and we loved it.Barbecued eggplant glazed with honey misoI am not a fan of eggplants but this was pretty good. After scraping off some of the miso (as it was too salty for my liking), the eggplant was actually palatable! It was so soft it almost melted in the mouth and I loved the slight chargrilled taste. The honey miso made it a really appetising dish indeed.Grilled gamba carabinerosI was really excited to see gamba carabineros on the menu. Gamba carabineros are a type of Spanish red prawn and ever since I ate them in Barcelona, I could not stop thinking about them. Like the ones I had in Barcelona, these were simply grilled with sea salt. The prawn was sweet and fresh but not as fresh as the ones in Barcelona as the meat was not as firm. Still one of the better prawns in Singapore though! For gamba carabineros, you MUST eat the brain juice! According to the chef in Barcelona, that is the best part of the prawn and the reason why gamba carabineros are so highly prized. Do not worry though, for the juice is really sweet.Handmade mochi with peanut and green tea powderThe mochi was extremely soft and chewy, sweet but not cloying. I preferred dipping it into the green tea powder for a slight bitterness.Milk pudding with red beansThis dessert was disappointing. While the pudding was smooth, it lacked taste and the red beans were too dry to help. This left an unpleasant taste and texture in our mouth.SummaryCost: ~$580 for 2 people, with 4 alcoholic drinksFood: Excellent steak! You have to order the A5!!!Service: Polite but slightly slowAmbience: Romantic, counter seating recommendedDress code: Smart casualWill I recommend it? Definitely!"
Chinese,Geylang Claypot Rice,-1,"New business in the area! Replacing Cedele (moved to punggol waterway) in the same spot opposite My Village shopping centre. I've not eaten the claypot rice at geylang before so am not able to make a comparison. You have to pre-order the claypot rice before you reach the place so that you can skip the 30 mins wait of preparation. hmmmm thats kinda troublesome to me. Teh! The claypot rice comes in 2 sizes. Small $18, good for 2  & large $28 good for 4. The server will ask if you would like to mix the salted fish and dark soy sauce while he mix the rice. Traditionally, salted fish is added in for a smoked fragrant. It might look intimidating to some because it looks like a piece of stale meat. The claypot rice is really good! The chicken & chinese sausage portion is generous, in comparison, the few strands of choy sim on top of it looks pathetic. Anyway i think its for plating purpose. If you would like to add more vegs, they have many choices on their menu. We had nai bai with fried enoki, tofu with prawn & salted veg duck soup. The veg & tofu are ok.. I didnt like the salted veg duck soup. Its too salty for me & doesnt go well with the rice. It should go well with plain rice. There isnt a crowd during lunch. The servers are attentive to the extent that whenever someone dropped their chopsticks, they rushed to us. The shape of the bowls that they are using should be changed! It doesnt hold the chopsticks well and it rolls off our table. But they look chic for ... claypot rice. I will return for lunch as its air conditioned & water is served. Not too bad to hide from the heat. Hmm yes, gst + service charge. Total bill: $97.60 for 6 of us."
Steakhouses,Gordon Grill,1,"A quiet, understated restaurant, I've found my new favourite restaurant in town. This is a cosy restaurant in beige, both the furnishing and the waiter/waitresses. The food, like the service, is excellent, unpretentious and of good value. This is a place perfect if you love a quiet evening of good food, no frills, and want to focus on just your food and company. My first assessment of a restaurant's quality is the bread basket. I believe if a restaurant puts the effort to serve good warm bread that comes free, it can't go very wrong. And we polished off the bread. We weren't even that hungry. The Caesar salad with anchovies was so unassuming, we were a little disappointed at first glance. But once we started, we couldn't stop. The quail was exquisite. Paired with foie gras, and balanced with walnuts and beetroot, it was flavorful and yet not over-powering. Slightly crispy skin and juicy inside. I ate this 2 weeks ago and I still dream of it. I was reluctant to order the chicken at first, because well, it's chicken. Chicken to me is usually a safe choice, can't go very wrong, but not fantastic either. But Gordon Grill's grilled farm chicken as brought chicken to a whole new level. Once again, flavorful, juicy, not oily, and brought out the taste of chicken so well. The chicken melted in my mouth. I thought I died and went to chicken heaven. The grilled pork was pink with perfection. I can't go on further without my mouth watering again. Every dish we had was prepared with thought and care, it was evident. This place is as if it stopped in time where quiet dignity and taking pride in preparing a quality filling meal were cherished. I can't wait to go back there."
Steakhouses,Gordon Grill,1,"Fine dining with great service, lovely facility, and excellent food!  It's pricey which keeps most of the riffraff out - this means you can get a table at the last minute and enjoy a quiet meal with out jostling for position.   The staff is adequately trained and do their best to make it a special eventing.  The food is a nice fusion of continental and new American and everything taste wonderful.  They love to provide table service for everything from the salmon carpaccio to the crepes Suzette.  Wine list isn't too exhaustive but it has what you nee.  Their steaks are super tinder and done just as you like.  Flawless evening that will let you pay the big bill without too much regret."
Steakhouses,Gordon Grill,1,"Gordon Grill is a stalwart of the Singapore dining scene ; solid, dependable with comforting with great service and equally great food. We might be occasionally distracted by the new trendy restaurants popping up on the dining scene, but when it comes to deciding on a place where it's cosy, peaceful and reliable, we head straight for Gordon Grill.Food : We always look forward to the crispy snack they provide along with the bread basket. I don't know what it's called but it's uber yummy! I also really like the bread basket. I'm a huge fan of the chilled angel hair pasta with king crab and caviar. One can opt to have it prepared warm as well, but I prefer the chilled version. The lobster bisque is lovely but the highlight of my meal is naturallement, the grilled ribeye. The Snake River Farm wagyu is one of the best ribeye steaks I've had in Singapore (Fat Cow uses the same one we had done charcoal grill style) and they bring it out on the beef trolley to show you the marbling and ask you how much of it you want. Half the fun of having the crepes Suzette is watching it done table side and it's always done really well.Ambience : Cosy and peaceful without loud music or loud conversation. It might be fine dining but it's not overly formal.Service : One of the best. They make it a point to recognise their customers and their preferences. I approve. All service in Singapore should aspire to their standards.I make it a point to try and go at least once a month. You should too!"
Steakhouses,Gordon Grill,1,Gordon grill is a perennial favorite of mine from the old days. They had a complete revamp some years ago with a new chef Gan Swee Lai. A completely new menu. The set for lunch is affordable at $50 and $60 for 4 and 5 courses respectively. The food is very good and portions are very generous. A great meal and worth a visit for all occasions.
Chinese,Hill Street Fried Kway Teow,1,"This is one of the few places which I will save my calories for. The plate of CKT is moist & the cockles (very slightly cooked) is super. One bite, you can taste the wok-hei, the crunchiness (the bean sprouts, garlic & tiny bits or pork lard), and the moistness the noodles & cockles. Sweet heaven! I always need to restraint myself in this Bedok South Market. Go on vegetarian diet for a month, then allocate calories to Hill Street Fried Kway Teow.I rarely queue for food. No matter how good it is. If the waiting is too long, I'd just eat something else.Still, this is one of the few CKT that is worth the calories & cholesterol."
Chinese,Hill Street Fried Kway Teow,-1,"I've had this char kuay teow for more than a decade now because I do live just one block away. It is good and above average for char kuay teows. However, the quality has dropped since the old old uncle has retired, and his son (?) took over. The noodles are underfried, and are a little soggier than before. The flavor is still there, but because it is wetter, it is not as awesome as the old uncle's frying. I ate this when it was only $2. Now it's $3.50 or $4 for a plate..."
Chinese,Hill Street Fried Kway Teow,1,Still one of the best Fried Kway Teow in Singapore. Best served when you fried extra egg on it
Chinese,Hill Street Fried Kway Teow,-1,"Some like it dryer, some like it a little bit more wet; all a personal preference. I like mine a little more wet with big juicy blood cockles (aka seahum).I had this when they were still really at Hill Street. I remember really enjoying it there. After years of mostly trying to avoid this dish for health issues, i very occasionally dig in to this once or twice year only.The queue here is always long and I bought the biggest baddest plate they got which was the $4 portion with an added $1 for seahum totalling to $5. Still tasty, has the wokhei taste people look for in this dish, but not so wet with eggy goodness as it was before. The seahum that day was lacklustre to say the least. Small and shrivelled.Although the queues here still snake till the moment they off their lights... I feel it has turned average. Still better than many of the new unknowns, but definitely no where as good as they were before.3.2 Stars"
Chinese,Hill Street Fried Kway Teow,1,"Once or if we're lucky, twice every year we get to fly to the Food Paradise that is Singapore. This is one of our ""go to"" food centres when we're in Singapore.Usually the tell-tale sign of a good dish or chef is the lines out the front but I think some people just enjoy lining up for food at times in Singapore without their being any substance behind the food for my tastes and although the Char Kway Teow was good here, I don't think the massive line represents how good it was in regards to others we went to and isn't always a measure of quality.Another gauge is that there's photos of celebrities, certificate of awards and merit and newspaper clippings adorning the stalls sign or posted at every convenience but it seems to be becoming more and more popular amongst stalls and not always a denominator of quality.Char Kway Teow is a wok fried dish and usually is served with some sort of seafood and can vary from having an array of prawns, to squid and cockles (a type of shell fish) with flat rice noodles which are all cooked at an extremely high heat. The skill of the chef is always evident in how they can infuse the ""Wok Hei"" aka wok's breath or flavour of the wok into their fare and balance that with all the other flavours going on in a very complex flavoured dish.Although the flavours balanced very well, the Wok Hei wasn't as noticeable and prominent as some hawkers, it was still beautifully crafted and as much as the Wok Hei is important to the overall flavour of the dish, the little bits of pork lard are a signature too and an absolute must which there was plenty of. If you like it a little spicy, ask for chilli when ordering.Overall I think it was an excellent example of Char Kway Teow and it's getting more and more difficult to find really good ones in Singapore. For me if it hasn't got Wok Hei, it makes the difference between good and impressive and this lacked that substance and pow that you get when the Wok Hei is infused to perfection. Given Hill Streets Kway Teow's reputation and a glimpse of how good it could be from my taste, I'll be back again to confirm whether it was an ""off"" day or not but with a 20 minute line, if it's not stellar next time, I won't be back.Cheers!Dave."
Chinese,Hill Street Fried Kway Teow,1,Sorry guys this stall is one of my favorite stall to spend my cholesterol credits.  Just went there yesterday ordered the big plate at 4 bucks and endured the wait for 20 minutes.  The Q forms an L shape to the stall.  If you lines up starting at the pillar on your right that be 40 minutes minimum.  So i was lucky to just before the L.  Noticing this stall got an average of 3.5 is pretty unfair so thought do a 5 to get the scores up.  If it is that bad why bother 40 minutes for a simple dish as this and brings you nothing but carbohydrate and cholesterol etc.  so thete we go get your fix here buy be zen and wait with a smile.
Chinese,Hill Street Fried Kway Teow,1,The line can be so exasperating that you feel that you need to buy more than one plate.And you totally should. Worry about the calories tomorrow.
Chinese,Hill Street Fried Kway Teow,1,"Award winning fried kway teow in bedok area. The store is rated by makansutra as die die must try. Though the amount of oil they used can be quite generous, the food is definitely worthy of the long queue that is always there!"
Chinese,Hill Street Fried Kway Teow,-1,"I don't eat Fried Kuay Teow often, because it is not the best for diets but when I do, I often go only for the best. So you can imagine, I was really excited when I got to try the Hill Street Char Kway Teow. It's pretty flavourful. The kway teow was done well and blended well in the soy sauce with the generous serving of ingredients - beansprouts, chinese sausage, clams, chives, etc.It was a little underwhelming though, because I've heard SO MUCH about it. But it is still in all a decent plate of CKT. My final verdict: I won't travel for it, but if I happen to be in the area, I'll be happy to tuck into a plate of this local classic. You should decide for yourself too!"
Chinese,Hill Street Fried Kway Teow,-1,"Not the most healthy of dishes, but judging by the length of the queues, most people seem willing to take this risk. The standard of the Fried Kway Teow remains the same, not suffering any dip in form and has been consistently ranked among the best, if not the best in Singapore. The long queues are quite annoying as waiting times can sometime be up to 30mins or more for just one plate of fried kway teow. The food centre itself is fairly huge, with ample seating, but because it shares the space with a wet market, it might not be the most conducive place to have it at."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Famous Michelin-star bak chor mee stall in SG. The noodle here is very flavorful - strong flavors across sweet/salty/sour/spicy which makes the bak chor mee standout. They also give you a lot of sides to accompany the noodle - sliced pork, minced pork, wonton, meatballs, liver, noodle crisps - everything taste excellent and a good balance to the noodle. Portion is big which probably explains the above average price. Would go back again if in the area. However, while this is a very good bak chor mee, it's probably not good enough to warrant 1 hour+ wait during peak hours"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Michelin 1-Star (2016) coffee shop stall with 1-2 hr long queue. Arrived 11.20am, with over 1 hr wait in line, in hot humidity. Each bowl is freshly individually prepared, average 2-5 min per customer depending on # bowls order at $6, $8, $10. Recommend $6 bowl, better value. Tasty noodles in chili and vinegar sauce, with pork balls, mince pork, liver, wanton. Good noodles, but not worth 1 hr wait and price. Of Michelin cuisines tasted in France, Germany, Italy, USA, am not sure how this one-star was awarded. At best, only bib gourmand, in my view. Not worth long wait, come off peak hours if curious to try. Many other good bak chor noodles elsewhere with better queues and price."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,You can write 10-15 Yelp reviews while on queue!I personally didn't mind the wait and thoroughly enjoyed the noodles after ~1.5hr of waiting. Maybe I was just hungry? I wish I had ordered a larger bowl after waiting for that long.I'm not sure if I'd be back but it's definitely a place to try out at least once because if its Michelin status.
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"Noodle in general is good. Abit salty for me, but still ok lar... however, queues up for 1.5+ for a bowl of pork noodle, maybe not as worth though. U decide..."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,Pretty solid place with some awesome flavours. I had the dry noodles and it was really awesome to get so many different pork meat varities in different forms. The sauce is a bit spicy and the soup delicious. Not something I would wait for but worth a one time visit.
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"2017 Michelin stars: 1The dish is delicious. Let's get that right out of the way. So much so, that I've spent some time now at home replicating the magic that is Tai Hwa Pork Noodle. Obviously my homemade version isn't as good, but with some tweaks I think it could be a passable substitute. Here is where the wheels fall off the wagon. It's cheap and has a lot of fan fare because of the single star it's received. On our first attempt, we waited for about 1.25 hours and only moved 4 tiles (we used the tiles on the floor to determine how far we had to go) which was not much. We gave up.We returned the next morning 30 minutes before opening and received number `11`. If you guys are missing a number `11`, I might know why. It was another hour wait before we got our food -- this time we were determined; which was delicious as I've mentioned. The whole ordeal of waiting in the heat of Singaporean weather was just lost on me. Yes the food was delicious. Yes it was cheap. But for a Michelin star you have to do something above and beyond. I feel like with the thousands of hawker stalls all over Singapore, you could more places similar to this with delicious food and less of the brouhaha.. It's the challenge that Yelp and Michelin diners face -- seek these places out! Find the undiscovered gems in areas that people may not frequent. Blaze the trail for others to follow. Don't just let your choice of place be governed by these yelp ratings which are always way too subjective. You might find something you really like... A diamond in the rough."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Since this was listed on the Michellin Guide, I have to give it a try. I planned an early dinner visit to avoid the long queues that people reported. Arrived at 5pm and there was a queue but tolerable. Waited 30 minutes for my food. A good estimate of wait time is count the number of people in front of you. Multiply by 2 as each is likely ordering for 2 people. Then multiply by 2 again as it takes 2 mins to prepare a bowl of noodles. So # of people in front of you * 4 = average wait time. Is it worth waiting more than 30 mins? I don't think so. The bak chor mee (minced pork Noodles) is ok. Nothing to scream about. I had the $8 dry version with mee pok (flat yellow egg noodles). Good presentation with a big bowl and generous with the meat (sliced pork, minced pork, sliced liver, gyoza and deep fried fish (ti po)). A dash of lettuce and no braised mushrooms. The black vinegar used for the sauce is flavorful which makes bak chor mee good. There is a ji chai soup for $6 which in my mind is way over priced. Dried seaweed is put into the broth used for the soup version of bak chor mee. Can skip without missing anything. A good dry version of bak chor mee needs to have mushroom sauce and nice vinegar. This place missed out on the mushroom. Presentation wise, tai Hwa has it better than others. The over sized bowl makes the noodles very appealing to the eye. Remember it still has a lot of carbs. My suggestion is to go at off peak times, order the $6 dry or soup version and if wait is longer than 30 mins, come back another time."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"This place gets 4 stars for the 2 hour wait...  It just might not be worth it.  I know I wouldn't line up again. The only incredible part of this is how slow the line moves.  The food is pretty good, and would be on my 5 star list (also has a michelin star) if there wasn't a line.  The liver is extremely well done, and tender.  The noodles are pretty good, but does this make it significantly better than other bak chor mee places? Nah. It's the best you'll get but not worth the wait if you can go elsewhere.  I'd try it once, if there's almost no line, and that's it. People line up before they open so maybe consider getting there very early?"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"One word. AMAZING. We went on a Tuesday morning, thinking it wouldn't be packed. But when we got to the store at around 10:30, there was already roughly 20 people in line. After roughly 2 hours in the brutal heat and watching countless happy customers bypass us with their freshly cooked noodles, we finally got our orders in.And let me say this. The wait was totally worth it. The noodles were hand pulled, very flavourful after soaking up the vinegary soup base. There was a wide selection of minced pork, liver, sliced pork, wontons and crispy fish on the side of the bowl. Plus you could add freshly chopped chili peppers on top to enhance the flavours. The combination of all the toppings was like heaven in a bite. Crunchy, savoury, sour and spicy. Definitely cant go wrong with a meal this good, especially with the pricing being $8 for medium."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"One of the two hawker food stalls awarded a Michelin star! The line can be long, and it does take a while to get your food. But just know that it's because it's a popular spot. Also, they make the noodles one bowl at a time.Two noodles options: with soup or dry. Both noodles have a mix of pork meat and organs and wontons. We got one of each, and I would say the dry one, bak chor mee, is the more flavorful one. A mix of chili, soy sauce, vinegar on the bottom; freshly cooked noodles on top; then the meats and wontons.Four sizes available. $5, $6 (regular), $8, $10."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,The queue was pretty short when I dropped by. It was just a 15 minutes wait. Maybe because the regulars knew that the staffs were going for 15-minutes lunch break soon at 2.30pm. I was lucky to be the second last order to be made before the break.Orders that cannot be completed by 2.30pm would be given a queue number.The serving looked a tab small for S$10 and served with a bowl of seaweed soup. I was not full after finishing it and seem to be lacking of the wow factor. The sauce was a tab bland although not too vinegary. Like that the pig's liver was cooked just right - tender. There's lots of pieces of crispy flat fish in it.
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"I got to Tai Hwa 30 minutes after opening and waited in line 1 hour 15 minutes. I appreciated that each batch of meat was cooked to order for just the right amount of time, ensuring tender pork and liver. The noodles were springy and the sauce punchy and well balanced. While I definitely enjoyed my noodles, it was not amongst my favorites in Singapore. If I lived in the neighborhood I would visit again. Otherwise I am sure places with equally delicious noodles and a shorter wait exist. Just have to be in the know I guess!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"Overrated.Is it significantly better than your average bak chor mee? Yes.Is a tiny handful of noodles (in a deceptively large bowl) good enough to be worth $6 and 0.5-2 hours of your time? No.Say an hour of your time is worth only $8. Would you pay $10-22 for this bowl of noodles (if it meant no queueing up)? If not, then what are you doing here?"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"Now that it has received a Michelin star, there are more tourists joining the queue for some bak chor mee. We went at 5pm on a Friday and it still took about 45 minutes to wait in line for the food. There were about 14 people ahead of me. But we saw there were only 2 people in line at 6pm. Hard to find the sweet spot on when the wait will be shortest. The queue system is neater now. Halfway through the wait (maybe 5-6 people ahead of you), you will be asked to place your order on the right side and then go back to your queue spot to wait. The noodle tasted better when eaten at the coffee shop. I ordered the $6 bowl as recommended by other yelpers and it definitely had more ingredients than what I previously remembered. I would have skipped the meatball soup if I knew there were more 2 meatballs in the $6 portion. I ended up with too many meatballs as the soup came with 15 meatballs for $6. It was soft but a bit on the salty side. I still gave it a 3 stars because of the queue system. Not everyone can stand for that long. I rather you order it and then get a number or buzzer and wait."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Whilst making my research on a trip to Singapore, this food stall caught my eye being rated 1 Star in Michelin Guide 2017 for Singapore, also being ranked No. 1 in the World Street Food Masters List 2017. I went to the shop at around 10.30 a.m. on a Wednesday. The location isn't quite easy to find as it's kind of hidden at the ground floor eatery of an apartment. When I got there, the queue was about reaching the metal rollers of the shop. And it takes about 35-40 mins before it's my turn to place my order. Having ordered the medium portion and collected the food, I am amazed by that presentation of food in a rather huge bowl. It's REALLY big! Taste wise, it's rather obvious that Vinegar plays a big role in the sauce. The pork is cooked to perfection, tender and juicy! The soup/broth served together with seaweed has a strong taste too. It feels like it has been cooked for long hours. I have also ordered an extra bowl of meatballs which tastes really good too!However so, it's rather regrettable where whilst the food being one so spectacular, it doesn't really stay in my taste buds. It just doesn't make me feel like ""I'll come back one day"". Note:- Closed on 1st and 3rd Monday of the month. - Queue can get rather long. By the time I've finished my food, at about 11.30 a.m., it is safe to say that the queue has doubled, although it is a Wednesday morning. - Happy Chef Western Food serves pretty decent Chicken Chop too! Do give it a try! Direction: Take the exit from Lavender Station (East West MRT Line), turn left and walk to the back of Immigration and Checkpoint Authority Building, cross the bridge into the residential areas (apartments) and look for Block 466. Visited 11 Oct 2017. Food ordered: Pork Noodle (Medium portion, SGD 8.00), add-on Meatball soup (SGD 6.00) - Considering the portion, it feels like it's a little overpriced, but having awarded with a Michelin Star, worth it!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"Well, it's good, but to come specially for this place - there are so many good eating places in Singapore- so again - I enjoyed my dish - but unless you really coming around 17:00 - when the q is quit short - I wouldn't bother"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"1 hour wait for this one Michelin star bak chor mee noodles! Pretty good time if you ask me.This was literally the best thing I ate in Singapore! We only came here by chance to try one of the michelin star hawker stalls, and this was most convenient to us. It was the first time I inhaled my food on this trip. I was only there for 4 days, and I've lived in Hong Kong for a while so the Chinese styled food did not wow me but this did! Now I didn't have much expectation for it since it didn't look that appealing but the taste was amazing! The flat noodles we got had a chewy consistency, al dente, which is how I like mine. The sauce was what made it amazing! Now, I don't typically like my noodles in soup since it makes the noodles soft and soggy. This sauce was spectacular. It had a vinegary taste (which some people may not like), and perfectly salted. Not too strong either. The condiments on top were what differentiated this from just noodles. ...my mouth is watering as I am writing this. The generous slices of liver that melt in your mouth is how they got me. I've never had liver so perfectly cooked before, and I've never liked it due to its chewiness and grainy texture. But this was was just melt in your mouth liver, and it was so good! Comes with a cup of liver/seaweed soup. It's so good! Reminds me of my momma's soup but taste so much better! I don't know if you can tell, but I love this place.Everything was cooked so fast too! The line was definitely not appealing but it moves fast so I was quite happy. They were efficient with cooking, and they made everything right in front of you so it was impressive.Need drinks too? You can go right next to it. Get some coffee or lemon honey. They make it right in front of you! The location may not be the most gorgeous but its the food that matters. Would defos come back if I were in Singapore again!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,China style noodles! Definitely order a large bowl. You have to wait a long time so might as well eat more. :)
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"The Michelin Star wasn't awarded for the late afternoon one hour wait or shabby looking exterior. Endure the wait, though, and you'll get an incredible bowl of Pork noodles. I asked for $10, dry - and it was phenomenal. The noodles were perfectly cooked, supplemented by a refreshing soup. If you can endure the wait - bring water - you'll be rewarded."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"This changes your expectations of a Michelin star meal. Firstly you have to be ok waiting for 45 minutes in line. The noodles were good made of all different forms of pork but my favorites was still the basic meatballs. If you look at this as a bowl of noodles in isolation it was ok, what made it special was the effort the noodles seemed to take juxtaposed with the price."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"Meh, I thought the noodle was very mediocre and missed any flavor. Not worth it for me."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Mee Is WorthyThe results are in and all the culinary buzz in Singapore has been filled with nothing but the official Singapore Michelin Guide, about who's worthy and who's not. I don't normally intentionally queue just to try out the latest recommendations but, since we were in leave on Thursday, a friend of ours had suggested heading over to eat the newly crowned, 1 michelin star Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles. She's been a regular customer there, years before all the hype started but has recently avoided it a bit due to the crazy crowds since the stalls inauguration. While walking over, we were crossing our fingers as her friend who has ate there the day before, waited an hour during lunch and we were hoping that we would have better luck at 3.30 in the afternoon. I love my minced pork noodles. The gf knows I have his obsession with it and she could see the excitement in me, knowing that I was not only finally going to satisfy my craving for minced pork noodles but was going to try what is apparently THE BEST minced pork noodles in Singapore now. When we got there, there were about 12-15 people in the queue, but seeing how fast the owner was churning out each bowl, we decided to queue (Thank goodness). The speed of his cooking is generally fast, with us only waiting for 30 mins, not too bad considering we had 12-15 people ahead of us with some ordering 2 to 3 bowls. A first glance at the price kind of shocked me. $5, $6, $8 and $10? That had to be the most expensive Minced Pork Noodles I've come across but once we ordered, I could understand why. Unlike other minced pork noodles, Tai Hwa was very generous with their ingredients. A good serving on minced pork, lots of liver, sliced pork, crispy fried fish (Bian Yu), 2 meatballs and 2 large dumplings, it certainly was value for the $6 (which is their regular size). While I went with the traditional Mee Pok (flat noodles) with Chilli, the gf, who doesn't take chilli went with the Mee Kia (thin noodles) with no chilli. First words of advice? Go with the chilli, or just a little bit of you're not a chilli eater. The key of any dry noodle dish, to me, is the sauce it comes with and while the non-chilli dish was still fairly tasty, the star of the dish had to be the chilli sauce used and the vinegar (there's no vinegar on the non-chilli versions although you may add it in yourself on the side). Firstly? The sauce. It was full of flavour without being overly salty. It had a lot of depth and vinegar was not only fragrant but it added a lot of soul into the dish. I can't quite pin point exactly what made the vinegar so special, but it definitely wasn't any regular black vinegar that was used. The Noodles The noodles itself was wonderfully cooked. Perfectly al dante, the noodles managed to soak up the delicious sauce yet remain springy and crisp. The Ingredients While the meatballs were pretty standard, the rest of the items were immaculately cooked. The minced pork had a great fat to meat ratio, the dumplings were very tasty and the liver.... The liver was cooked perfectly. Lightly blanched, the liver was still soft and tender, retaining some pinkish-ness, a wonderful contrast to the normal hard, overcooked and powdery livers a lot of other places offer. The SoupIf you're not a fan of the dried versions, that the soup is worth having a try too! The soup is to die for. Even though it was just a little side bowl, the fact that it was chalky showed how much pork has been cooked in it and it tasted like it too. Definitely the best soup from a noodle shop I've had.So the big question is...... Are they worthy of that Michelin star? Yes! I'm not shy to say this but this has certainly been THE best Mince Pork Noodle I've had and I'll be happy to queue again to have another round of it... As long as the queue isn't anything more that 30 mins."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"So this place received a gazillion accolades Michelin star being one among them. Expect lineups at 4PM as well, you've 3 dishes to choose from, but overall didn't care too much for mine, just walked away from mine after eating 2/3rds of it. But at these provrsx(10$ and under) worth the try if line up isn't too long."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,Don't need much review. This place has enough five stars. The first Michelle star pork noodle in the world. So proud that our singapore hawker food made it to the Michelle star. Remains as my top choice if I have the time to queue!
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"I'm not sure what the hype is, but it's basically a pork noodle bowl (Bak Chor Mee) with minced pork, sliced pork, liver, meatballs, wontons, and salted fish.  It was pretty good tasting but I felt it had way too much going on in it.  Maybe I prefer the simpler dishes I had grown accustomed to during my stay here, but I would say it's not worth going out of your way for.  If you absolutely must go, it's probably best to go during the daytime here."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"I am definitely a fan of the food, but not the line for it. Unfortunately, it has gotten even more popular with the Michelin Star, hence it was one hour and forty minutes line up time for my friends. Perhaps, they can open up a second store somewhere else as I seriously want to go back and have this soon!! X.X"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"Had a similar Pork noodle 20 years ago when I was in singapore and thought wanna try one this time during my formula one visit. Friend recommended to me this Michelin one star rated noodle shop. Expected to wait for an hour but guess what, we have waited for 2 full hours for this noodles! The noodle itself was very good but definitely I will never wait this long again for this!!!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"Lured by a shining Michelin star, we queued up behind 25 minutes of other patrons.In short, this joint has a lot of hype, it admirably tries to fulfill that hype, but at the end of the day, it's a mom and pop spot serving authentic, cultural noodle dishes on a thin margin. In long, flavors of their noodle dishes are indeed complex. But almost to a fault. The dry egg noodle dish is very sour with vinegar. The liver assaults your taste buds with iron and minerals. The dumplings are nearly all wrapping skin and what seafood is in them is all but lost.  The soupy rice noodle is a bit better, but the noodles lack al dente texture. The sliced pork is both tough and sans flavor.  The ground pork is again tough and relatively bland. The fried fish chip is an interesting flare and provides a bit of seafood complexity to the dish, as does seaweed slivers. Singapore is an immaculate city, but an interesting practice occurred at this joint: the noodle prep man filled noodles into each of our bowls...but then he stacked our two noodle dishes together such that the dirty side of one dish was on top of the noodles of our other dish.  After the top dish touched the soiled countertop, it defied logic why he'd place the dish on top of the other bowl's noodles, but hey, what do I know.  In sum, certainly worth a try, but not all that glitters with Michelin stars is gold."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"I think most Westerners need to be careful with this Michelin Star as it isn't for many taste palates. It is definitely worth a try but I spoke to many foreigners who didn't like the dish. I arrived at 2:30 on a weekday and there was practically no line/queue. I ordered the $6 bowl and watched the magic happen with the food.I agree, the noodles are extra springy with a beautiful texture. Otherwise, even for me, the liver was a bit strong for my taste. I still finished my portion fairly quickly and was still hungry so got myself another order. :)If you can do so, come between the peak hours and just try it out!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"My friends and I pretty much ordered their entire menu.  The wet style noodles were simple, flavorful pork base broth look funn.   This same soup was used in the seaweed soup and the meatball soup.  The dry style noodles had some spicy, vinegar mixture with yellow flat noodles.  The dry style mixture wasn't overpowering amd it was well controlled. Out of all the dishes my favorite was the meatballs, because the juice of the meat seemingly burst as you bite into it, the pork flavors fills your palates as it travels.  The only thing is the line is terrible, I personally wouldn't stand in line again."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"As I was on a Michelin food hunt that day, after eating the soy sauce chicken in Chinatown, I immediately headed over to this noodle place for lunch. Unlike the other stall, they don't really advertise their Michelin star and the only way you'll know about it is a small plaque at the very front of the line. I got there at lunch time and it was a little over an hour wait. Be warned that it can get quite hot and humid while waiting as there was only one fan aimed at the queue. Whilst lining up, I noticed there were signs for a $5, $6, $10, and $12 noodle. Asking around, people said that they were simply denoting the size of noodles but after receiving my order, that's not quite the case. Ordering was a bit daunting but somehow I managed to communicate for a $5 dry, non-spicy Bak Chor Mee. Watching him prepare your bowl of noodle was quite confusing, he was dipping meats and noodles and sauces into different bowls before dumping them all into one. Then after handling the raw meats with his bare hands, he'll handle your cash payment...When I got my order, I noticed my soup was lacking the seaweed that I had seen in the pictures and inquired why. They simply stated it was because I ordered the $5 version, the full version was at $6, so I found out the hard way the pricing didn't dictate size alone. The noodle came with some minced pork, some liver, a meatball, a wonton, and some crunchy meat that I couldn't identify. Texturally, the dish was very interesting, with bites alternating between crunchy and soft as you ate. In terms of the flavor profile, it really wasn't for me. The vinegar was simply too overpowering and I don't really get the hype with this dish. The side bowl of soup was also quite bland, nothing really special. If you're a fan of sour and spicy, it might be worth it to give it a try despite the wait, but for people that have a penchant for more savory flavors, give this place a pass."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"First saw pics of the noodles from Tai Hwa on Instagram and knew this would be one of my first stops during our Singapore trip.  After reading a few reviews, I knew to avoid this place during peak times so we ended up coming for a late lunch on a Monday.  For some reason the taxi driver dropped us off at the wrong location (not far but ended up walking a few blocks).  I was glad to have google maps open so that we could find this place.  We arrived to find a short line and waited about 5 mins before placing our order.  For those that don't speak Mandarin, I'm not sure how successful you'll be ordering food here as the guy who took our order did not speak Cantonese and spoke very very little English.  It took a total of 15 minutes before we sat down to eat.  I ended up with a $5 bak chor mee bowl of noodles and it definitely lived up to the hype!  I would definitely wait an hour for a bowl of their dry bak chor mee noodles in a heartbeat!  A definite must try when coming to Singapore!!!!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Review for Nov2016 - Queue is long (about 1hr) during the lunch hour, but would definitely come here. Came with a friend and had both variants of the noodles and it was definitely worth the wait and would come back again"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Woot! Michelin Star food for $6!Here's a tip, if you go at 8am, you can get a number and have your spot saved in line. Then come back at 9:30 (when they open) and wait for your number to be called.I had number 23 and my number wasn't called till almost 11. (the stand also primarily speak in Chinese ).I got the Bak Chor Mee and the soup base is really the most awesome part of the dish. The dish is spicy/tangy so definitely more of an acquired taste for some people."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"dear sweet fanciful moses this was the best bowl of noodles I've ever had.  I normally like the toppings better than noodles in noodle dishes because I'm not a huge carbs person, but I ate an entire large bowl of these.  They are perfectly fresh al dente goodness with theeee best flavor to them.  I also usually shy away from liver but this tasted.. less... livery? lol.  Sorry for the lame description.  Much foodie.  The dried fish bits were my favorite!  Sounds gross but yum I could've eaten a bag of those like chips on their own.I got in line at 10:50 am on a Sunday and still waited 45 minutes in a line of mayyyybe 20 people.  They really take their time and make each bowl perfectly.  I would honestly queue up for that long again.  It was completely worth it.  I'm sure it's only going to get busier as they've been awarded a Michelin star so go early to avoid sweating your ass off in a line all day.Go for the large $10 bowl.  I don't have a huge appetite and I still finished the large bowl fine.  If you're gonna queue for that long, go big or go home :) Went great with a $1.50 iced lemon tea from the stall right next to it!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"not quite sure that this hawker stand lived up to the 1-michelin star hype in my book...me and justin b. showed up on a tuesday afternoon around 2pm hoping to catch the in between lunch/dinner lull, but i guess everyone else had the same idea b/c the line was at least 30-40 people deep when we showed up. the line moves so slow and its kind of a bummer there's no limit to the amount of food that 1 person can order so you may see a single person ahead of you that buys like 6 bowls of food and with the hot/humid singapore weather and only a few fans in the area to cool you down...waiting in line is not a fun experience haha. the only redeeming thing is that there is a drink stand next door where you can get a cold soda to help cool down or order food from the other stalls to satisfy your hunger pains haha...we ended up waiting 2 hours for our bowl of food :( upon first bite of the bak chor mee, i wasnt immediately wow-ed. the whole sweet/sour/tangy flavor combination isnt my favorite...but as i continued to eat, my bowl of noodles, pork, dumplings, and fish balls grew on me and i liked the flavors more and more with each bite. i think we ordered the $8 SGD bowl which is about $5ish USD and for that price point, its still a great deal and value. i had never had bak chor mee before this experience and i'm glad i got to experience this dish while in singapore...but i cannot justify this 2-hour wait."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,We had the Bak Chor Mee. Nice.
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"I'm of Chiu chow descent so trust me when I tell you I love love love bak chor mee. We came here right before it opened to get a number tag for the cue. We made it about 10 mins before they opened and got #9. The whole wait time was about 20-30 mins. Definitely get there before they open because the line goes out the door the moment the store actually is open for orders. Once the restaurant opens, they take the numbers first and then everyone else in the line. It was our last meal in Singapore so we definitely went all out. Instead of one $10 bowl, we both got two $5 bowls which meant more food for the price! It's pricier than other hawker stands and other restaurants that serve it.  You can taste the difference and it tastes good. I can see why they got a Michelin star. The bowls are small though. The people there speak little English and mostly mandarin. Ordering was easy though because there aren't too many choices. The bak chor mee dry is definitely the way to go. It's vinegary but not overpowering and the noodles are a perfect texture. I hate soggy noodles so this was a big deal to me. There isn't a lot of meat but most dishes don't come with a lot of meat in south east Asia. We also got the meatball soup! Yummy! I would definitely come back as long as I could avoid the lines. Definitely go a little earlier, even if it's like 2 minutes. The line gets long, fast!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"As a tourist from the US who generally likes Asian noodle dishes I was intrigued by the favorable reviews of this eatery. And as it was with in walking distance from my hotel I decided to track down this establishment. What I found was a small hawker stall just off North Bridge road (about a 1/4 mile NE of Raffles) that, in the middle of the afternoon, had a queue. No other stall I passed along the way had anyone waiting that time of day. The queue was a very promising sign.It was fortunate that I had written down ""bak chor mee"" (even though I had no idea what this means beyond being a noodle dish -- I was being adventuresome), because there is no menu anywhere and the brusque but hard working staff doesn't seem to understand much English. Upon my placing the order phonetically, the man asked ,me a question I didn't understand. I guessed that he wanted to know if I wanted chili sauce on my noodles. I nodded.My bowl of noodles indeed came with the chili sauce and was garnished with several types of pork -- shredded, sliced, and some pieces of liver-- together with few other items I couldn't identify. I was extremely pleased with the noodles which were very tasty, although I might have backed off a little on the chili sauce as a personal preference ( just for reference: I like my salsas between mild and medium). A bowl of soup accompanied the noodles, a flavorful (seaweed?) both that had a little aftertaste of liver. Overall the very savory noodles made tracking down this little hawker stall well worthwhile."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"singapore is never short of cheap and good food. but when it comes to having awesome nosh, singaporeans will need to scour every single nook and crany for the best. When you feel like chowing down on a good bowl of pork noodle (Bak Chor Mee as we would call it), please come here. The queue during lunch might be a little daunting, so try to come down during off peak hours but even during off peak, one can expect to wait for about 15 to 20 minutes to see the front of the queue. So don't come famished but almost hungry. :)Remember the soup nazi from Seinfeld? Well, we do have an experience with the whole ordering process. You will have to order in a particular sequence - price of the bowl you want, type of noodle, dry or soup and then all the misc special request (less spicy, more vinegar, no liver etc). If in a group, please remember to order per bowl. so don't go like ""2 bowls of $5 mee pok, no chill"" - you will be left #ignored. When your bowl is presented to you, you will be glad you actually waited. the noodles are cooked perfectly with all the quality ingredients one will want in a bowl of bak chor mee. you have the minced pork, the liver slices, the singluar meatball, that lonely piece of vegetable mixed in a crazy sauce that one will relish till the very last drop. Mix them all up and slowly enjoy the goodness in every bite. The accompanying soup is also really flavourful and one can only wonder how their wonton soup will taste like! (till the next time I go back).So to have some authentic pork noodle, come down here and get an awesome bowl or two! Please invite me along the next time anyone is going down and I will be glad to join you in enjoying an awesome bowl of bak chor mee!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"Its a one michelin star place.. went there with high expectations. The line wasn't too bad as compared to the previous two famous carts I'd been to. I just didn't like the noodles, the texture and taste is something I just didn't enjoy. That being said, you should still give it a try, I'm pretty sure most people standing in line really enjoyed it."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Queued for approximately an hour and a half a week after the Michelin announcement.I came with a huge expectation and, to be perfectly honest, was left pretty disappointed by the dish. Although the noodle base was undoubtedly unique, I found the noodle and other ingredients very normal and forgettable. Then again, I do admit that I have never been a fan of Bak Chor Mee.This stall (barely) deserves its one star due to its incredible noodle base; however, I will probably not come back anytime soon."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"Favorite fan of Bak Chor Mee forever. Heard about this no. 1 BC mee and it's snaking queue. Hence tried it today. Ordered a $10 & $6, after queueing for 45mins. Extremely disappointed. Noodles is thick and not so springy.  Ingredients are fresh. Base sauce is so so. Overall not really worth the price and time. Doubtful will come and queue again.Advice to owner is that he should concentrate on cooking instead of also being the cashier. Hence undercooked noodles."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Like others before me have said, if you can get past waiting in line for 30 mins on average (and upwards of 1hr during peak hours and days), then you're in for a real treat. I ordered the much talked about pork noodles with the broth on the side, and it was absolutely delicious. While I have had noodles of this style elsewhere, I have never tried it with the unique vinegar sauce mixture that the chef so craftily pours over the fresh noodles which are made on site.All in all, this is a great example of a local gem!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"It must be a good day for me as I didn't have to Q for a long time.  I think the noodle used to be better, now, it's simply too overrated.  I have tasted better and hope Tai Hwa will return to the standard it used to have when it was at Hill Street."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Tiny hawker stand with only three items on their menu. Heard the line can get crazy. We went around 3 hoping no one would be there but still had to wait about 10-15 mins. Not bad. They have a dry noodle, a soup noodle and a beef ball soup. My husband got the dry noodle and I got the soup noodle. It is interesting how you pick a size by $ amount and not small medium or large. Every stands in line on the left where you pick up food and the guy will call you up to the right side to place your order. My husband loved his dry noodle. My soup noodle was just so so. Dry noodle definitely tasted a lot better. I would never wait an hour for the soup noodle."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"When my wife asked me why I did not heed the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate recommendation to ""limit refined grains"", I answered, ""It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every bowl of bak chor mee that comes from the coffee shop on Crawford Lane.'""I had to put it down in writing on Yelp before I could order my extra large bowl of bak chor mee."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Definitely one of the best Mee Pok I have tasted in Singapore.Nice chewy al dented style of egg noodles mixed in with pork lard, soy sauce and chilli.Definitely worth a bite if you have the time to stand in line for at least 30 minutes"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"If you like waiting in line and paying a lot of money for hawker food, this is the place for you. If you don't like waiting in line and paying a lot of money for hawker food, this is still the place for you. Whenever I'm away from Singapore, I have dreams about this bowl of goodness. Haters can nitpick all they want, but IMMA LET YOU FINISH, BUT THIS IS THE BEST BAK CHOR MEE OF ALL TIME."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"AMAZING.i was taken here not knowing what bak chor mee even was, nor what awaited me. my delicate californian constitution could not handle the heat and 1 hour 10 min wait in line to get my food, but damn, was all that worth it! (it helped that i waited in line with 2 lovely ladies).this bak chor mee was delicious. chilli, vinegar, and perfectly QQ noodles!didn't really care about the wonton, but the pork and liver were delicious (although i wish there were more).i can't really compare to other bak chor mee, since i'm a novice, but i know good food, and this was good food."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"I've not had vinegary mee pok before. There, I said it. What's with the judgey looks, people? Geez!So I embarked upon a mee pok trail, and this was one of those die die must tries. We got there slightly before 11am, and a wild queue of 18-20 people greets us. Curses! Still, we duly wait, as dining companion really likes her mee pok. Fast forward about 40mins later, it's finally our turn and we both end up with mee kia as it turns out, while she likes mee pok, the mee pok noodles here are too doughy for her liking. And it's true, even the mee kia seems pudgier than those elsewhere, and these upsized strands have a less QQ bite than I'd prefer. Sad.Vinegar hit is ok, neither too subtle nor overpowering. The chilli leans towards the mild side, and the ingredients are mostly meaty stuff- one wanton, one meat ball, some minced pork, pork slices and liver. A bit measly, really. You know the episode where Karl Pilkington goes to China, and when he treks the wall and goes 'it's not a Great wall. It's an alright wall. It's the Alright Wall of China.'? Yup, for me, it's just an alright bowl of noodles. Plus the ridiculous wait.. I think not."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"According to Teochew Ah Pa, the price has gone up with inflation. Now the smallest bowl is $5 and we ordered 3 bowls of dry BCM, 2 Mee Kia and 1 Mee Pok. The queue is of course, very long as always.Alas, the much-awaited BCM came up and yes, it was the same old taste that we've had previously. It does not hold back on vinegar and seasonings, and thus give a satisfying kick which lures you back for more.No pork lard but crispy pieces of flatfish still works for us. My family love our BCM the spicy way but their plain version is equally competent. You can self service to more vinegar if you like.That said, we noted a problem this time round. Too much sodium in the wanton dumplings and also noodles. I did not remember the food being so heavily seasoned the last time (or my memory must be failing......) But it could also be this distinctive taste or that keeps the business going so well after many years.Indeed, we got thirsty hours after the meal. But well, once-in-a-blue-moon bowl of comforting and satisfying Bak Chor Mee won't hurt too much."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"A lot of newspapers, articles, etc about this place. One ridiculous article i found was posted right in front of the cashier, which says about two men fighting due to the queuing and police came to reconcile. waited for 20 mins, they normally had one lady take your order first and then the old man cooking. he used many bowls by putting some little meat, soup in every bowl and then dump to another place. he never ended up using that same bowl for serving. i really had no idea what he was doing. all the meat like pork and pork liver were raw. he basically just put the soup in it so it cooked by itself. the noodles are quite normal, the soup bowl on the side was very fatty and oily, the flavor is just vinegar plus spicy sauce. i don't see why it is so famous or special."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Each time I think of Bak Chor Mee, I dutifully make my way down to this stall to get my fix.Springy noodles cooked al dente style (chinese version) with lots of tasty tiiny meat chunks, meat balls, salted fish tossed in a delicious blend of vinegar, chilli, soya sauce and oil!There's liver too but I always opt out of that.Best ever - not two thumbs up but 10 fingers up!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"A really unassuming establishment until you see how popular it is by the line that forms.  Tai Hwa isn't a popular hawker center like Newton's or Maxwell's but it is really a gem! When I first got my bowl, I was thinking ""this is it for $6?"" but it really is a small bowl of quality goodness.  Every single item is thoughtfully crafted and placed as an integral part of a whole.  Their preparation is arguably inefficient; however, you won't argue any longer once you eat it!  Always get the pork noodles, dry.  It sits in a small pool of vinegar-based sauce and the noodles are FRESH.  As in, they are handmade (at least that's what it seems) and cooked upon order.  Topping the noodles are a mixture of minced pork, liver, dry fried fish, etc.  You get a bowl of soup on the side as well.I saw some other people with bigger portions so you can probably get there for extra $$ if you're feeling hungrier or want more goodness."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"I am not a fan of Bak Chor Mee and I find the Bak Chor Mee here average. But people who love it are queuing an average of 20-30 minutes for the food. From own experience of queuing, I deduced that the wait is long and the queue is slow because the person preparing the the food seem slow..Further observing the preparation prove I am right but that is because they treat their food seriously. Even though I am not their fan, I have friends around me who are and they make it a point to go all the way to Larvender MRT to have it. Those who are interested can try for themselves and they are open most of the days from 9.30am to 9pm except 1st and 3rd Monday of each month."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"The best minced pork noodle in Singapore.  The noodle is cooked just al dente ..... most other hawkers in Singapore tend to over-cook their noodles but not this chap.  The morsels of meat are also cooked just right, tender, juicy and succulent.  This just shows to me that a lot of attention to detail has gone into cooking that bowl of noodle.Expensive for a bowl of hawker noodle but well worth the price.  The only pet peeve I have for this place is the long wait.  Budget for at least an hour of queuing.  Is it worth the wait ..... hmm, the jury is still out as I really dislike having to stand in line and wait for my food.  But, if you want to try the best ""bak chor mee"" in Singapore, this is the place!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Nothing else is comparable to the noodles here. This is evidenced by the long lines every day, and I do mean every day! We were there at 10.30am on a wednesday and there is a line of 10 persons! Once we joined the line, 5 more were behind us immediately!Tip: morning is cooked by the boss himself, lunch hour his ""sous-chef"", dinner another worker. I only go when it is either the boss himself or the sous-chef. It is all in the number of nano-seconds the noodle is cooked! Yes, technicalities of Asian hawker food!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"I have lived away for some 12 years and every time i come backto Singapore, which is about twice a year, i head straight here, the morning after my arrival, for my fav authentic hawker food. Each time, the noodles do not disappoint. The secret is in the mix:  the sacue is sufficiently vinegary and sweet and sallty, the ingredients are fresh and of good quality, and the noodles are always cooked just right. What really seals the deal for me is the stock which is amazing, Over the years the prices have escalated so that my visit each time runs up a bill close to $50, for two persons eating there and a to go order for three at home. Notwithstanding the prohibitive cost I return. MY one complaint right now is that for to go orders, they do not offer you the soup sp you have to purchase a soup bowl to go!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Totally worth the wait and everytime I've been here, there will definitely be a wait.The crispy fried flatfish is what makes all TW difference for this bcm.Order a bowl of too soft but nonetheless tasty dumpling soup to round off your meal after all that waiting!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"First things first, the queue is VERY LONG. And it's not those fast moving queue, so you do need quite a bit of patience if you want to get a taste of this bar chor mee!My friend told me that the 'dry' one is what people think is the better one, so I tried it. But in my humble opinion, the soup one actually taste better overall. Nothing very spectacular in my opinion, so I'm not very sure if I'll come back, especially with such a long queue............."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"This stall was previously located in Marina Sq Food Court and always has a long queue for the bak chor mee. Even foreigners that come here want to try the noodles before they return to their countries.The special feature is the Chilli sauce and the flavourful soup! Their pig's liver is also done very nicely. Cooked for just the right amount of time, resulting is tender slices of liver heaven. I was sort of shocked when i saw that the whole bowl was filled with oil, but i was told that this is actually the yardstick for all Bak Chor Mees in Singapore. Anyway, i was not disappointed with the taste, not too salty and very flavourful with just a highlight of sourness coming from the vinegar.I also liked the fried bits of lard and the liver bits, which wasn't too overpowering and given in the correct amount. The crispy fish was also a nice addition to the usual bak chor mee dish. A must try."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Hands down the best Bak Chor Mee in Singapore. When it comes to flavor and freshness, Tai Hwa is hard to beat. Some people prefer their Bak Chor Mee to incorporate tomato based sauce, but my tastes are more aligned to the vinegar / chili heavy mix that Tai Hwa cooks up. The wontons, liver, meatballs and dried salted fish give the extra ""oomph"" that make the noodles truly a complete dish."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"I'd known before making my way down to Lavender that Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles was a popular bak chor mee stall, with some food bloggers going so far as to claim that it was the best bak chor mee stall in Singapore. I was all ready to give it the benefit of the doubt, seeing as how it was a family-run stall dating back to 1932. Despite the knowledge of all these facts its snaking queue on a Wednesday evening managed to surprise me anyway, and contributed to the already high expectations that I'd had of the noodles here.Um sadly. Wasn't impressed.I kind of get why Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles has its loyal following. The gravy here has a much higher ratio of vinegar than most bak chor mees do, which I suppose goes down well with those who like their noodles with an acidic kick. The fragrant and crisp pieces of ti por or fried solefish provided a nice crunch that provided a pleasant contrast with the springy mee kia (thin noodles), and the pork used here in all its forms - minced, sliced, livers and balls - is fresh, chewy and of good quality. Oh, the one thing that I liked about the bak chor mee here was the broth that came with it. I could literally see a meat cloud in it, which was a precursor to how intensely meaty and flavorful it tasted.I'm going to go all out blasphemous and say that I don't get the hype about the bak chor mee here. At all. This was okay bak chor mee, yes - but to call it the best bak chor mee in Singapore when I can't even decide if I prefer it to the ones sold by the hawkers in my neighbourhood? Nahhh, I'll take convenience any day.Just a note of caution if you're thinking of heading here for bak chor mee: They're supposed to close at 9 pm, but their actual closing time is when they run out of ingredients for the day, which, on the day I visited, was 7.30 pm."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"This is so underwhelming. I can't believe I queued 40 minutes for this during lunch time! It was time to see what's the fuss about when I decided to join the snaking queue in this coffeeshop tucked away in a sleepy estate of Crawford Lane. All I can say is I don't see what is so special about it. Add in the waiting time and I feel cheated. The noodles were quite stiff and starchy, and there was so much sole fish in it and too little minced pork.I had a better time with the homemade iced lemon tea from the same coffeeshop - be sure to order that if you need to try the noodles!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Delicious minced meat noodles, but on the pricey side, starts from $5 to $10 a bowl. Not sure what lies in the $10 bowl but taste wise, it hits the BCM spot all the time. Long queues expected but moderately fast."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"The best minced pork noodle I have ever had. Other minced pork noodles no longer satisfy my cravings anymore since I have had this many years ago. Today, the noodles still taste as good as it was in the past. Love the fried flatfish and the wanton that comes with it."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Fave bcm in town! but be prepared to queue for this, usually it will take me around 30-45 mins depending on the length of the queue and how many orders per person."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"Not sure what else I can say other than that this is most definitely the best Bak Chor Mee in Singapore.Once you can get past the queue in this little kopitiam, you'll finally find yourself holding onto a bowl of the most perfectly cooked noodles, doused in a casually good vinegar base. One of the best parts of this is how well cooked their minced and sliced pork is - soo tender and juicy considering how fine they are. The pork balls are also very tasty without having that artificial flavour to it, and to crown it off, they add some bits of crispy deep fried dried fish, which adds that bit of crunch and saltiness to the whole bowl. One wonders why this doesn't feature in more minced pork noodles sold everywhere because it makes such a good combination! The soup on the side is so well brewed as well, you can actually taste the pork from which the flavour comes from. None of that artificial flavouring that we frown upon, I don't think!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,I accidentally found this place. I had a pork noodle. The portion of food is quite too big for a girl like me. The taste is unique and delicious. Love it!!
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,Be prepared to queue. It is worth it. Is there a better pork noodle out there? Nope there never will be
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,Hands down the best bak chor mee in Singapore! I love the vinegar with the chilli and so much porky goodness in the soup! Super long queue so make sure you bring some entertainment! Wait times can be up to one hour at peak times.
Chinese,Hong Heng Fried Sotong Prawn Mee,1,"This being my first time to Singapore / spending any meaningful time in Southeast Asia - a cuisine that I don't eat a whole lot of when I am home - has resulted in me trying to get a taste of the local cuisine as much as possible. Today took us to the Tiong Bahru Market, which I will say I enjoy much better than the Maxwell Center the day before - much more spacious, more seating, etc. Hong Heng is easy to find as it's the first place to the left once you go up the escalator to the second floor. The line moves relatively quickly, and ordering is simple: you can order a small, medium, or large portion, for S$3 at the smallest and moving up S$1 for each larger size. The serving isn't anything fancy - just a whole bunch of noodles on a flat plate (maybe a bowl would be a better way to serve), along with a small amount of spice on the side, as we requested it to be a bit more mild.I'm not sure if it's the oil/broth that the noodles are cooked in, but wow - we wolfed this plate down as fast as humanly possible. They were so good and flavorful, and while some noodles (Asian, Italian pasta, or otherwise) can get a bit messy when they are inundated with liquid, these noodles were just filled with juicy, prawn-based goodness. The main drawback, surprisingly for me (as I'm not a fan of shrimp), is that we got 2 measly pieces of shrimp in the entire plate. We did order a small, but given the generous portion size on the noodles, I would have anticipated a bit more seafood.All in all, though, I really enjoyed the noodles here. There's a Bib Gourmand sticker on the stall, and IMO it is well-earned and deserved. Sometimes really good food can be simply done, and that is the way it certainly ends up here at Hong Heng."
Chinese,Hong Heng Fried Sotong Prawn Mee,-1,"Tried this once a year or two ago, long before this stall was awarded a Michelin Bib Gourmand.I found this noodle to be pretty mediocre; it was just like a typical stir-fried plate of hokkien mee. Nothing particularly stood out in terms of taste profile, although I do recall them being generous when it came to its portion.This is not worth a Bib Gourmand for me. I argue that the much more commercialised Thye Hong Hokkien Mee is better, although this review may admittedly be slightly outdated. It is time to pay Tiong Bahru a visit again."
Chinese,Hong Heng Fried Sotong Prawn Mee,1,"While Fried Hokkien Mee may not be on my list of favourite foods, I love the plates of fried noodles dished out daily by the uncle from this stall and never fail to order it whenever I am in the area. The noodles are really fried here, unlike many stalls that just give it a little stir and serve it to you. The effort put into cooking up this brilliant plate of hokkien mee is evidenced by the great care taken by the uncle as he fries up a storm to ensure that the noodles take up the slightly charred flavour from the wok. The stock used is very flavourful, giving the noodles the fresh full flavour of prawns. They are also pretty generous with their prawns and sotongs and the seafoods served up are always fresh. Be sure to go there early for lunch if you wish to have a plate as they often sell out by 1pm."
Chinese,Hup Hup Minced Meat Noodle,1,Worthy selection to Singapore Michelin Guide. The teochew minced meat is amazing all for about $3-$4 a bowl.
Chinese,Hup Hup Minced Meat Noodle,-1,"Stumbled upon Hup Hup and noticed the press coverage posted on their stall. I decided to give it a try since it was off-peak hours with no queue at all. In the end, I wasn't disappointing.  Many pluses for this bowl of bak chor mee. First, the texture of the noodles is really appealing. It's got a good springy bite and grabs the sauce well. Also generous ingredients from minced pork to pig's liver, and sliced mushrooms. The standout for me is the fried wonton skins. At first seemingly extraneous given its just fried wonton wrappers without any filling, they lend the dish a nice texture contrast. The only drawback for me was the sauce. I prefer mine to be on the  vinegary side and Hup Hup uses a good deal of tomato ketchup. But having tried their version, I wish I could bring the fried wonton skins to some of my favorite vinegary bak chor mee places and we have a win-win!All up though, Hup Hup still offers a decent bowl of bak chor mee and you get pretty generous portions for the $3-4 a bowl."
Chinese,Jalan Sultan Prawn Mee,1,Some of the best prawn mee soup in sg.I have been a fan of Jln Sultan hae mee soup since the 1970s!The place can be hot and stuffy though.I find it is better to go before the lunch rush as it can get crowded.This and the beach rd hae mee soup are the 2 favourite places for me to indulge in this dish!
Chinese,Jalan Sultan Prawn Mee,1,"Flavour city. Sauce and soup is great, not overdone. Prawns are fresh. Noodles are done perfectly. Parking is limited. They are open until 3:30 but frequently sell out by 2:30."
Chinese,Jalan Sultan Prawn Mee,1,"Love the prawn noodles here. The soup version is much better than the dry version as the prawn soup here is awesome. We like that it is not too oily and has that great seafood broth taste. Very sweet! Love the bee-hoon-mee combination.The standard combination of ngo hiang is great to go with the prawn noodles. The ngo hiang is not the best out there, but it's a great side dish to share among when you are there.Service is swift and quick. I guess the broth is all ready and just need to be poured over the noodles.Opening hours are from 8am to 3.30pm. So it can get really hot here in the mid-afternoon humidity. Ice cold barley or lime juice is great with the noodles. They are closed on tuesdays."
Chinese,Jalan Sultan Prawn Mee,1,"Its very common for shops to have names when they're nowhere near the supposed location and Jalan Sultan Prawn Mee is one of them. Introduced by a friend who found out I enjoyed everything prawn related, the stall is conveniently located near Kallang MRT and is just a short 3min walk away. It gets packed during lunch really quickly so be prepared to wait or visit after the peak hours to be safe and if you don't like to wait. Service there is swift and curt, with no room for small talk. The prawns are decently large and  full of flavor and the prices are much, much cheaper compared to other more 'famous' places."
Chinese,Jiang-Nan Chun,1,"Sunday brunch at Jiang Nan Chun is phenomenal. From the succulent roasted meats, to the exquisite soups and the well-executed mains, just about every dish on the fairly extensive ala carte buffet menu was flawless. Not one bad dish. So even if we had to waddle out of the restaurant, Jiang Nan Chun is definitely on my to-return list!Apart from Cherry Garden, this is the only other place I'd ever advise anyone to visit for such ala carte buffet brunches.Service was as of you'd expect of a Four Seasons, attentive but unintrusive, efficient and slick but warm and gracious."
Chinese,Jiang-Nan Chun,1,Excellent menu and great service. So good I went twice.(A special mention to Dolly)So when in Singapore do yourself a favour.#facxual_events
Chinese,Jiang-Nan Chun,1,"After Dreams of the Red Chambers and Legend of the West, Four Seasons Jiang Nan Chun introduces their Literature series once again and the theme is none other than ""Four Great Beauties of China"". Not only will you be mesmerized by the exceeded beauty of the dishes, one will be dazzled by the narration that reveals the other side of these legendary personalities. Why does Yang Gui Fei love soaking in fragrant baths and how can the fishes be so amazed by beauty of Xishi that they forgot to swim and drowned to their blissful death? The 5-course menu is really worth trying and I highly recommend you to do so before it ends on 31st Jan :)"
Asian Fusion,Labyrinth,1,"Labyrinth provides what you would expect of a single Michelin star restaurant. A pleasant mix of dishes - some will blow you away (the starter snacks, chilli crab ice cream and short rib were phenomenal) with their flavour and imagination. Others are just delicious (the uni, dumpling and snow.) Coming out at $230sgd for the uni, two cocktails and a third of a bottle of wine, which seemed fairly reasonable. I am glad I went - but also not desperate to return."
Asian Fusion,Labyrinth,-1,Not worth the money. The concept is not original and their bag of tricks does not make up for the lack of flavor and miniature portions.
Asian Fusion,Labyrinth,1,"2017 Michelin Stars: 1Staff and service was fine, food was above average. I'd give them 3.5 stars if I could, but will err on the side of generosity in this case. The place is hard to find; once you're in the area the center doesn't seem to list it in obvious places so good luck. From memory, it's on the second floor, near some escalators that are by an entrance that is away from the center 'stage' (?)."
Asian Fusion,Labyrinth,1,"The restaurant was located at the space formerly occupied by Space by TungLok. The place was decorated in all blacks. Besides offering lunch set and dinner sets, the restaurant also offered pre-theatre dinner set ($48++) on thursday to saturday at 6pm.TINGKATradish cake, rojak, nasi lemakThe radish cake was in a cylinder cone with a stick in the centre. Tasted not bad although felt it was a tab plain and wished one could taste shredded radish and dried shrimp in it. The crispy square puff was packed with rojak sauce in it. Interesting pack of flavours. The coconut flavoured chwee kueh was topped with sambal, and reminded one of nasi lemak.HIROSHIMA OYSTERlaksaThe noodle was created with coconut milk and a fat juicy hiroshima oyster was used to replace cockles which was usually found in laksa. The floss was spicy with flavours of laksa.DUCKbraised duck dumplingThe dumplings were served in a bamboo basket with soup in a glass bowl. The dumplings were covered in a transparent skin made of sweet potato. Somehow felt that the filling was over flavoured and covered the duck's flavour.TIGER PRAWN ($10 SUPPLEMENT) pen cai risottoThe fa cai had a light and crispy texture. The risotto was well flavoured with oyster sauce, shiitake mushrooms , beancurd skin, and dried shrimps .XIAO LONG BAO chendolA greenish xiao long bao served in a bamboo basket with gula melaka syrup in a small jar. The green skin was made to represent the green jelly strips usually found in chendol. The xiao long bao was packed with jelly cubes and red bean. Interesting pack of flavours when ate it in one mouthful.CIGARreese's peanut butter chocolateThe cigar was a chocolate bar with chocolate creme in it, dusted with cocoa powder, with the bottom part dusted with liquid nitrogen to make look like burn part. It was served in a glass ashtray with peanut crumbles as the burnt ashes. It was accompanied with a glass of earl grey tea with a ball of ice to look like a glass of Cognac. The rich chocolate stick was balanced by the light floral tea.PETIT FOURIt was Dehydrated Pandan with Kaya Butter macaron. It was light and not too sweet.I washed down the meal with a glass of Lychee Martinis ($12++)Vodka, Lychee Liqueur, Lychee Extract which came with 2 pieces of canned lychee and tasted quite sweet."
Asian Fusion,Labyrinth,-1,"Let me start by saying the food we had was great - very innovative take on Singapore Street Food. There was only one ""Amuse Bouche"" item (a puff filled with fermented shrimp) which I wasn't a big fan of. The rest was great - especially enjoyed a crab dish which included crab ice spicy cream. There is a Prix Fixe Menu so no choices other than they will upsell you on Wagyu Beef instead of the regular beef and a better shrimp for one of the seafood dishes... I found the upsale thing a bit awkward as they actually come to your table with a slab of Wagyu and some big shrimp and try to convince you to pay the extra amount to improve your dinner... strange approach for a Michelin Starred Fixed Price Menu.The issue I had with the restaurant was mainly the service. We waited a bit before finally asking if we could order a cocktail - our waiter seemed confused about our order (a gin martini and an old fashioned...not very difficult). It was our last night in Singapore and we were looking to get the whole experience starting with drinks...getting some wine with dinner etc. Before our drinks came we were served the Amuse Bouche course...then quickly after that our first course came out....I then asked the waiter if our drinks would be coming out soon...since usually we would have preferred them BEFORE dinner...again the waiter looked confused then asked us again what drinks we had ordered, a little later he returned and said 5 more minutes. By the time we received our drinks the third course was arriving and of course we never got a chance to order wine...Our waiter was friendly but the elaborate explanations of the food was lost on his poor pronunciations. We didn't understand anything he was saying....which was unfortunate as the dishes were remarkably intricate.  After dinner we were not offered coffee or tea...I guess for the money I would never return or recommend to anyone but it's a shame because the food was really interesting."
Asian Fusion,Labyrinth,1,"6 COURSES DISCOVERY MENU AMUSE BOUCHEWe started with the Street Snacks of Radish Cake, Dehydrated Pandan with Kaya Butter, Rojak and very smooth Nasi Lemak that was served in the Rantang or metal food carrier.I really like the smooth Nasi Lemak that was served like Chwee Kueh with sambal and anchovies as toppings. The savoury radish cake had a crispy edge and was very fragrant, it looked just like a toasty marshmallow. The next Amuse Bouche that we had was the most beautiful keropok / prawn crackers that was injected with squid ink. This keropok was topped with mayo chili and beautiful orange fish roe and edible flower petal. BAK CHOR MEEBak Chor Mee is a popular local dishes and I usually love the distinct flavour of the chili and sourness that comes from vinegar. The Neo-Sin's version was noodle created from the squid skin served together with anchovies in the shape of minced meat and Hokkaido Scallop that looks like a fish cake. It was a miniature version of Bak Chor Mee that you could find in the local street market. You need to mix everything together to get the best flavour. This cute looking Bak Chor Mee was served on a small bowl with rooster on it, a popular bowl that brought out nostalgic feelings of eating street food during my childhood period.HAINANESE CURRY RICEThe miniature forest with bird ness and quail egg looked very magical when the staff served it in front of me. The green moss looked very delicate and who could guess that it was made from coriander. The white clay that covered the potato was imported from Spain, the 'black rock' minced chicken was very delicious and everything was put on the bed of quinoa curry. Again, it's very important to mix in all the elements to gain the true flavour. This was simply my favourite dish of the night, in terms of look as well as the strong spicy flavour that it gave. SINGAPORE CHILI CRABThis was the dish that took my breath away when I saw it on Instagram, so I was very excited about it. The chili ice cream was delicious, even when eaten by itself! It was moreover really delicious when mixed together with the soft shell crab. Presentation of each dish really mattered and it showed from the choice of plates that the restaurant used. This dish was presented on a light blue plate that resembled the sea, covered with mantou sand, some caviar, seaweed and foamy crab bisque.SATAY BEEFHubby was really concerned about the size of the beef when he saw the '80g' next to the menu but he was surprised that the beef was quite big. The Wagyu Ribeye was cooked medium rare, served with gnocchi (onion), satay espuma and rice cakes. The rice cakes in this case was peanut mocha which was skilfully wrapped in banana leaves. The beef was perfectly cooked and with the exact amount of layered fat to make it so enjoyable.XO FISHThe fish of the day was red garoupa with a hidden lobster claw served in the Teochew broth. This dish really reminded me of seafood gumbo although not as thick and heavy. The broth was quite light, filled with seafood flavour and mushroom. I found it best when I mixed the broth with the cooked tomato that was provided so it gave the tangy fresh flavour onto the mix.NEW ITEM: MINI APPLE TOFFEEChef Han came out from his kitchen and said hi to us. Not only that, he also brought out a surprising new item that will only be released in early April. It deceivingly looked like a mini apple toffee.PINAPPLE SORBETOur palate cleanser was a refreshing house-made pinapple sorbet and I joked to the staff that one spoon wasn't enough to clean our palate (hahaha). CHENDOL Xiao Long Bao (XLB)I want more of the Chendol XLB, it was a good start to dessert and the staff was so nice that she helped me take a pour shot by pouring the gula melaka slowly on top of the XLB. For a small item, it was quite rich since it has all the elements of chendol such as red bean, shaved ice and jellies.REESE'S CHOCOLATEThe staff playfully asked whether we smoke or drink before he carried out two ashtray filled with a cigar on each. On the other hand, he gave us a glass of Cognac. It was a peanut butter covered with dark chocolate and the Cognac was the refreshing Earl Grey tea.Now the question on people's mind will usually be 'is it worth the money that I paid for'. For me, it was really worth it especially when you consider the creativity, mixture of ingredients, presentation and passion that went into each dish.I had a very enjoyable night at Restaurant Labyrinth and so excited that they will add some new menu items soon. I went to the kitchen to thank Chef Han for his delicious food and to tell him that he needs to do a pop up dining in Perth... or I should just visit Singapore again."
Asian Fusion,Labyrinth,1,"In full transparency, I have not been to this location, but I have had the pleasure of dining from a menu prepared by Chef Han at an offsite location. I was impressed by the simplicity of the dishes and the amazing flavors that were achieved by combining different ingredients together. I never imaged that a sweet oyster sauce could go so well with fillet steak. My mind was blown!Chef Han's attention to detail and knowledge of the ingredients he uses in his dishes is unmatched. The combination of flavors and tastes create a unique experience that is authentically Singaporean, rather than a so-called fusion of other cuisines. I'm am excited to follow Chef Han as he takes on his next challenge of sourcing his ingredients locally and re-creating an authentic Singaporean fine dining experience, like no other Singaporean chef has done in the past."
Asian Fusion,Labyrinth,1,"Very friendly staff and very informative about the dish that we were going to eat. It's a great fine dining restaurant to have an intimate date.The food that Chef Han prepared was very creative, well presented and delicious. As for the price, it can be a bit pricey but all the staff here will look after you."
Asian Fusion,Labyrinth,1,"Gastro place, the tasting menu was excellent.  Service was superb as they adjusted for the no pork, no beef requirement for me.  It's a different take to the excellent Singaporean street food. Presentation was excellent and some of the plates were very innovative and good. Worth an experience."
Chinese,Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow,1,"The old airport road food centre has a lot of popular stalls selling hawker fare. One of these is Lao Fu Zhi Char Kway Teow (stir fried rice noodles).There is always a long queue but orders are taken very efficiently & served up fairly quickly by the aunty & uncle respectively. This dish is cooked using rice noodles, stir fried with bean sprouts, cockles, dark/sweet soy sauce & pork lard, imparting a slightly sweet savoury taste. Definitely a must try for first timers to this food centre."
Chinese,Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow,-1,"When someone mentioned to me about having a meal at Old Airport Food Centre, this stall comes into my mind! I have always been a fan of this and often queue up very long just to enjoy the Char Kway Teow (Black or White) - Stir Fried Rice Noodles. So this time, I went there on a weekday and to our surprise, no queue at all. I couldn't believe my eyes! Less than 5 minutes, I had my food on the table and seconds later, my digestive system was at work! However, my tongue bud wasn't impressed with the 'stuff' going into my stomach as I was wondering, what happened? Is the quality of the food the reason why the lack of queue? All these instantly came into my mind. The more I chew on the food. The less impressed I was. The quality of it has certainly dropped! It wasn't what I expect but it's still decent enough to come and enjoy it. I have certainly tasted better ones elsewhere. Perhaps I should return another day to try it again to confirm whether the standard has indeed dropped or this meal I had was just an one-off."
Chinese,Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow,-1,"Probably one of the most famous stalls in Old Airport Road, the queue grows quickly but the uncle also cooks quickly. The stall can be recognized by the music playing out of the boombox, and the auntie who takes orders very quickly. You can be the 10th person down the line and she's asking for your order! The kway teow was very wet and wasn't too oily, the flavour was there and I didn't eat chunks of lard but I could definitely taste the use of lard."
Chinese,Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow,-1,I cannot say it's no good because it was tasty but neither can I say that it was out-of-this-world kind of awesome too!Let's just say that I would order it if there is no queue but I wouldn't queue for it.
Chinese,Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow,-1,"Taste was good but not exceptional. Ingredients very stingy..Extremely poor value for money.. $5 buys you a few slices of lap Cheong, a few cockles, a tiny bit if egg, and that's it."
Chinese,Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow,1,"Fried kway teow is basically the Singaporean version of the more popular (within the US) Cantonese dish of chow fun, but honestly it's much better because of the amount of other stuff you'll get in it like prawns, fishcake, cockles, egg, and Chinese sausage all served steaming hot on a banana leaf.A long queue at this particular stand; one of the longer ones along with Nam Sing Hokkien Fried Mee.  This line moves much quicker however.  The fried kway teow made here was easily the best I had while I was in Singapore."
Chinese,Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow,1,"One of the trickiest things to assess is how good a dish is after a very long queue. It could very well be that the enjoyment of eating it was in large part due to the hunger accumulated  through the wait, but I'd like to ultimately think that it's all about the food.I've had some pretty good char kway teows in my time and this is definitely up there. If you can get past the fact that you might expect to wait for a good half an hour, it is everything you'd expect it to be. There is that sense that they have done this so often, and so well, that they almost can't do this in any other, nor could they ever do a bad plate. The man at the frying pan is all well kit up, complete with special glasses to prevent oil from splashing at him etc so you know he means business. My favourite parts of their char kway teow are the very distinct bits of egg you'll find unevenly lacing each bit spoonful of it. One confusing thing about this stall is their difference in pricing - they sell plates going at $3/4/5/8/10, and I haven't tried a wide enough range to know the difference.The plate I got today was for $5 and I have a inkling that the $5/8/10 versions come with prawns, which I werent a fan of because they weren't very well cooked, it's always a hassle peeling them and they don't contribute to the taste of the char kway teow at all.I also noticed that when you order more than one plates, while waiting to serve the next plate the lady serving you would cover your first plate with another plate, so the heat is kept in, a sight that while understated, tells me how meticulous they are in providing good service and good food, and that they care about how it tastes to us, even after the money has been passed."
Chinese,Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow,-1,"I went to the branch at Singapore Expo. Noodle texture was good. Lots of gravy, too sweet. Way too sweet. Cockles were over cooked, I'm okay with that. Must find a better store as this is way too sweet."
Chinese,Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow,-1,"It is amazing how many people queue for fried kway teow at this store, leaving almost no business for other similar stalls at Old Airport Road Food Centre.I was actually hoping for white leaf plates but in any case the dish was served on a disposable plate with pandan leaves. My colleagues thought it was too spicy for them but I thought it was alright. The variety here is drier but the flavours are well-balanced. Pretty generous amount of cockles mixed into it too. I thought it was lacking in the wok hei flavour I will like at a hawker centre but it is a pretty decent plate to have.Apparently, you can request to have your fried kway teow done with lard. I've heard amazing things about what lard can do to food from my mum. This makes it pretty enticing to try. I mean, if you want to indulge, might as well go all the way."
Chinese,Lei Garden,1,"Best dim sum in town. The restaurant comes direct from Hong Kong and the quality of the dim sum can't be beat. Although I have to say that my favorite has gotta be their double-boiled soup. Get the daily soup and it's not that bad in pricing. The chef also produces innovative dim sum that has a twist to the traditional dishes. One of my recent favorites is the fried you tiao with enoki mushrooms stuffed in it. Yums!Dessert is also lovely. The mango pomelo sago dessert is very yummy. Perfect for a hot summer day with just the right amount of sweetness and freshness provided by the fruits and pulp.Although situated on the third floor of an old building, you don't feel that it's the case once you step inside. Nice ambience with beautifully renovated interior and a view to the greeneries outside with the glass windows. Agree with the other reviews that the wait staff definitely tries to upsell you. Although, all you have to say is no, not interested and they will politely back down. Stand up for yourself and it'll only be mildly annoying. But agreed, 4 stars instead of 5."
Chinese,Lei Garden,-1,"L  ift lobby reception area is small and cramp.E nvironment within is newly renovated.I   ncredibly pushy staff who tries to sell you only their most expensive items!!!G uests here are mainly tourists!!!A  verage dishes at best. suckling pig and roast pork crispy but dry and porky meat.R elentlessly pushy staff even tried to sell their bottled appetizer for $18!!!D im sum touted as fresh from the oven was far from it, soggy crispy fried squid.E xpensive as can be!!! double boiled fish soup was $48, serves only 3.N ever again!!!"
Chinese,Lei Garden,-1,I find the dim sum here not too shady. Was under the impression that it is very posh and expensive due to the luxurious interior but it was quite reasonably priced. I like that it's very comfortable and not that noisy. The quality of the dim sum is quite good. I love the succulent huge prawns in their har gao. The char siew bao is also very fluffy and juicy. They have a chocolate custard salted egg yolk bun which is quite ok but not fantastic.
Chinese,Lei Garden,-1,"Lei Garden is a high end chinese restaurant. It serves exquisite chinese food. We ordered roast pork, peking duck and winter melon soup. Out of the 3, my favourite goes to winer melon soup. I can really taste the sweetness of the winter melon soup. Had a total of 3 bowls in total!As for peking duck, i find the sauce abit too salty and sweet. For the amount of price of dining here, i think i would be able to find better peking duck elsewhere.This is a good chinese restaurant with great ambience however, considering the price, i may not be back again."
Chinese,Lei Garden,-1,"Here's a place that i use to frquent but recently after its renovation rather it's really expensive and the crew hard sells and service depends on your expenditure. They aren't the friendliest like they used to when we were regulars.I had dinner there recently with about 5 dishes, including a fried noodle, steam fish, a vegetable dish and another meat dish and the bill came up to $600! It can be really pricey here now, but at least the dim sum is still quite good. Here's one place you HAVE to reserve seats in advance though. There's no way to have a weekend breakfast with reservation if you're a group of 4 and more."
Chinese,Lei Garden,-1,"As a child, we used to have family meals at Lei Garden frequently. For me, the dim sum trolleys were a reminder of the Sunday lunches of my childhood where we would grab everything and anything we liked with all the freedom that we, as children, were entitled to. It was with these same fond memories that we ate at Lei Garden again after many years of not visiting the restaurant, but either I'd grown up or the place has changed quite a bit since I'd last been.For one, the quality of the dim sum was not as I'd remembered it. My favourite dim sum is har gow and I would also eat as much of it as I could, but the har gow skin seemed to have become thicker than I remembered which made it far less enjoyable. The quality in general has certainly dropped a great deal but the price is still just as expensive. With the numerous dim sum places available at a more reasonable price, it is unlikely that I will visit Lei Garden again for the food."
Chinese,Lei Garden,-1,"My friends and I decided to celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival by having dinner at Lei Garden, which turned out to be top-notch for ambience and only passable for food.The place is swanky, I'll give you that. Fine bone china, multiple chopsticks (you know a Chinese restaurant is fancy when they give you more than one pair of chopsticks), cream-coloured walls and seats, thick linen napkins, and high-quality tea.For starters, we had some crispy roasted pork, cut into cubes and dipped into mustard sauce. I have never really understood the appeal of crispy roasted pork, but it's a Canton thing so I suppose Cantonese people like it. For me, I could only admire the fact that the pork was cut into perfect cubes without crumbling the crispy skin. Now how did they manage to do that? This puzzled me for a good part of the evening.A glistening roast duck suddenly appeared next to our table and disappeared just as quickly. They cut the skin into thin squares and wrapped them in a flour wrapper before serving to our table. The duck skin was roasted to crisp perfection but unfortunately tasteless. I slathered on generous amounts of tian mian jiang (Peking duck sauce) and just enjoyed the textures in my mouth - crispy skin, fresh cucumber, and soft flour wrapper.The most savoury dish was probably the twice-cooked pork belly, using pork bell with nice thick layers of fat. This is a traditional Chinese dish called dong bo rou) from Hangzhou, which is close to my home province of Jiangsu. This is usually one of my favourite dishes, but at Lei Gardens, the taste was not at all authentic.The latter half of the meal was filled with rather ordinary and uncomplicated dishes: stewed cabbage with mushrooms, stir-fried asparagus, fried rice, and fried noodles. Simple but well executed.By Singapore standards, this was decent Chinese food, but for this price, I would rather take my money elsewhere."
Noodles,Lor Mee 178,1,Want to be at the top of the food chain? Then you gotta have some Shark Meat Lor Mee. Enough said.
Noodles,Lor Mee 178,-1,"Not sure what to expect with this. I knew it works be noodle to some extent.Someone else already mentioned, the shark tastes just like fish. So no reason distinction as it is battered.There actually wasn't a line when I went..just a guy in front of me. Ordering was painless...They give you a bowl of the broth(which I thought would be more fluid but it was kinda thick...Like gelatinous. I shuttle have preferred reg liquid consistency). Then you had your condiments in nearby bowls.If you are doing take away, they wrap each component in separate little bags(noodle, fish..etc)..so when you get home you just dump then into bowl. It was tasty actually but again I would prefer a more liquid broth as the thickness was a bit overwhelming for me."
Noodles,Lor Mee 178,1,"To get things started, I don't like my food drenched in gravy. Dishes like Lor Mee, Hor Fun and Mee Fun incur my wrath - how can you enjoy the flavours when everything is soaked in thick gravy? Fortunately, Lor Mee 178 was worth the plunge and is probably the only Lor Mee I'll ever eat. (Please stay that way forever.)Here's the breakdown: you get a bowl of noodles in the thick brown gravy but that's not all, you also have fried shark meat, crispy fritter bites and more crunchy stuff topped onto your noodles. That might be what made it for me. The mix of crunchy with flavourful sauce that not too starchy and good noodles that blends with the sauce. I've read very opposing views on this dish, perhaps from people who prefer to more traditional braised variety but I like this adaptation. I will travel just for this one."
Noodles,Lor Mee 178,1,"It's so damn hard finding good lor mee in Singapore - also, it seems like it no longer is one of those dishes you can easily find at any food court so that makes the search even tougher. So, in light if these circumstances, Lor Mee 178 acts as one of my trusty haunts I fall back on when I just have to get a bowl.The gravy is fantastic - it has good flavour of the stock but isn't overwhelmingly starchy. What I really like about this stall is the shark nuggets! Actually, it iss really just fried fish bits that sound a little more exotic. The crispiness adds a good texture to the dish. Each bowl also comes along with the usual braised egg, pork belly and ngoh hiang.Ask for extra everything - vinegar, garlic paste, chilli sauce. Best way to enjoy this dish is to go over the top."
Noodles,Lor Mee 178,1,"My absolute favourite stall in Tiong Bahru market, which is saying a lot given that this food centre is teeming with loads of well-known stalls serving up excellent fare.The broth is flavourful and not too thick, and the accompanying fish is delicious. Make sure, however, to throw in shark nuggets for an additional 50 cents. These chewy and tasty morsels really propel the dish to giddying heights.I usually go a little crazy with the condiments, generously adding vinegar, garlic paste and chilli to the mix... but isn't that how lor mee is best enjoyed? Definitely a must-try, and easily a destination for those looking out for the best lor mee stalls in Singapore."
Noodles,Lor Mee 178,1,"Lor Mee that kicks ass but might not get you kisses.Tiong Bahru market, another food paradise of Singaporean delights.What to eat? Obviously, you're not one who's keen on wasting tummy space... if not you wouldn't be reading a review.Well, Jonny boy is here to help. Do you like Lor mee? If so, Don't waste time. Order from this stall. Served with deep fried shark meat and super crunchy flour crumbs, this Lor mee is heavenly. Gravy that's thick and full of tasty vinegary goodness. The shark meat (I don't take shark's fin's soup because of the cruel ways they 'hunt' for these but I figure if they used the whole shark, there's no issue) is deep fried and it kinda reminds me of fish and chips, without the chips.You are given free reign of garnishes so I recommend piling on the freshly cut chilli and lots of garlic. Your breath will smell for at least two hours (non garlic eaters would never kiss you) but it's worth it. Corporate rats be sure to confirm that you have no client meetings after your meal! Unless you get them to go with you for the Lor Mee."
Noodles,Lor Mee 178,1,"When a hawker stall has a long queue, join in. Even if it does not turned out to be super delicious, it won't be too bad either.  Fortunately, the Lor Mee($2.50) falls into the first category. Perhaps what draws regular crowd is the Shark Meat Fritters (add 50cents) and the braised gravy. Mix all the chilli sauce, grated ginger, vinegar, gravy, some crunchy stuff together with the noodles and you'll get a simple, comforting bowl of Lor Mee minus the braised egg and ngor hiong."
Noodles,Lor Mee 178,1,"Obviously Shark meat isnt the most common ingredient you'd find being sold in a dish. In fact, almost never. But the shark meat lor mee is actually quite nice. The shark meat is coated in a light batter and fried into crispy nuggets. When you bite into it, the meat is tender and you can taste the freshness of the shark meat. It goes very well with the thick lor mee gravy and yellow noodles."
Noodles,Lor Mee 178,-1,"Given the popularity of sharks fin soup in Asia, I find it curious that we don't see more restaurants selling sharks meat. Sharks meat is what gives this veteran of Tiong Bahru market its uniqueness. It serves a mean bowl of lor mee for $2.50 - for an additional $0.50 they'll toss in a few pieces of fried sharks meat in your bowl. Like fish fritters, it tastes awesome when eaten crispy, especially when it is soaked in starchy lor mee sauce to give it that delightful balance of crunchy soupiness. While the fritters themselves were well fried, I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the sharks meat and normal fish, though. Having this exotic dish already also means the stall could scrimp on more traditional accompaniments to lor mee - I couldn't find many pieces of egg, or ngoh hiong in my bowl of noodles, which, if not for the sharks meat, was nothing spectacular. Still worth visiting though, if only to check it off your list of must-tries in Singapore."
Chinese,Majestic,1,"Have not been here for a couple years and the standard of the food is just as good. We ordered their signature appetizer platter with an assortment of Foie Gras on a fresh slice of watermelon, Peking duck with garden salad and wasabi prawn. The small bite size portion is a great way to sample their different dishes without over ordering.We had the shark's fin cooked in shark's bone broth and the soup tasted amazing, and the sharks fin tasted savory and fantastic.We completed the meal with a plate of fried Ee-Fu noodles fried with mushrooms with a speckle of mentaiko. An overall satisfying meal except for the lack of waiters."
Chinese,Majestic,-1,"This is the worst food that I have ever had in my entire trip. The hotel lobby is nicely decorated with bright complementary style and the restaurant is a mixture with the modern element with a touch of Asia.The restaurant is tiny.We were here for a friend's birthday party and they placed us in this small claustrophobic ivory room. The service is unprofessional and our waitress have this lukewarm smile on her face all the time.We had Majestic degustation menu.--+ Crispy prawn is soggy and bland, it has nothing much to do with salty egg yolk, because it tasted like yesterday's fried shrimp. Seared foie gras on the water melon is the most gross foie gras that I ever had in my entire life. The liver tasted bitter and it has a urine smell.  There is this strange flour coating on the liver. It didn't taste seared, but fried.  However the 2,50 inch crispy skin of Peking duck is the best dish of the entire menu. ---Sharkfin soup with the crab meat.  The sharkfin soup is bland and the crab meat is tiny.  ---Poached sliced Wagyu beef with bean sprouts in soya sauce. Sliced beef were chewy and tasteless, bean sprouts isn't crisp and the overly salted soya sauce is over powering the whole dish.---Braised abalone and homemade bean curd. Bean curd didn't tasted homemade and it wasn't fresh. Abalone tasted like those from the can section. The whole dish was fishy. ---Steamed trio xiao long bao looked like tiny vacuum packages. Dough is flattened and soggy.   I can't taste what is different in between foie gras, black truffle or crab roe. Everything is bland. I took a bite on each one and left there. ---Stewed mee sua with Oyster was gross. The oyster were tiny, sandy and fishy. Mee sua tasted like dried noodles from any supermarket and the broth is tasteless. -++Crispy durian ice cream looks nicely fried and it was the most edible dish in the whole set. Our waitress who smiles like she's having tooth pain was serving us the wrong dish but she seemed like she doesn't want to serve us the right dish "" Do you still want your dish? Because we just served you the wrong dish."" Singapore is  like foodie heaven, save your money and go somewhere else."

Chinese,Majestic,1,"We've been to this place at least 3 times and each time have walked away very happy and satisfied, and I look forward to going back again.The wasabi prawns are truly remarkably delicious - so much so that I'm struggling to recall the other things we like to go with it.  The salt cod fried rice is also a winner and  a staple on our short list.  Delicious with a cold Tsing Tao.The topper offer is the durian ice cream fritter.  It is ridiculously rich, and before you wrinkle your nose, this is worth opening your mind (and piehole) for.  Rich durian ice cream comes inside a deep fried fritter - mixing hot and cold.  The flavor has a creamy flavor with an oniony bite.  And, yes, it tastes better than it smells (although there is very little smell from the ice cream.)  Must try."
Chinese,Majestic,1,"Located in Majestic Hotel, Majestic Restaurant serves modern Chinese and is one of the more popular restaurants for business lunches and dinners.Food : We loved the combination platter of crispy wasabi prawn, peking duck andpan-seared foie gras. The shark's bone soup with fish maw and beijing cabbage was rich and nourishing and we also really liked the pan seared cod fish and pan-seared fillet of rib eye with sesame sauce. The chilled mango pudding with black glutinous rice was an interesting play on flavours and texture.Ambience : PleasantService : Excellent"
Chinese,Majestic,1,"We had a post work day dinner at the Majestic with a fixed menu.  Every item was wonderful.  Especially tasty was the sliced peking duck and a combination dish of bean curd skin rolled with foie gras, chili crabmeat and three lychee skew mai."
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,1,"The restaurant is located on the second floor of the Grand Hyatt hotel. We had a group business dinner in the wine room, which is an experience in itself. You are sitting next to all of the first growth Bordeaux (Margaux, Latour, Lafite, Mouton Rothschild), lots of second growth, also DRC, Gaja and more - truly creates a special mood for the wine lovers. We had dinner family style - excellent crab cakes, chicken wings, a couple of salads, followed by steak, pan-fried chicken and salmon with French fries, Brussels sprouts and a few other side dishes. Dessert included a number of different sorbet, ice creams and more.Excellent service, both dinner, and wine.I definitely recommend the restaurant, but probably having an expense account would be a significant plus."
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,-1,"Review for soft launch of Beyond Burger:Day 1:How was the plant based Beyond burger? Yes, it was good for the novelty. I love food trucks and love the vibe here, but for $10, seems like they only cooked the patty and bun.... As a meat lover, this was overall ok. I was very surprised by how half the burger felt warm and the other cold. The patty, when eaten alone, didn't have much taste. The sauce, however, went well with the patty. Texture and color was also not close enough to beef. It had ok chewiness but not what I wanted in a beef patty, not dense enough? Color was very very red as well. Also, the veggies were not cooked so the onions were too raw for me. the veggies made the patty cold too quickly. And the cheese was mild in flavor and kept breaking into small pieces. Melted cheese in a burger please!!!! Day 2:Get the classic! The Asian don't need to bother. The sauce was a dry paste so it didn't really cover the patty. Didn't taste wasabi or siracha mayo. The patty still has a funky aftertaste, definitely did not fool me to think it was meat. The slaw had not much taste, should be pickled for more flavor. The burger was much smaller than the classic. Sorry my dear friends who I've misled to try the Asian. For those who try tomorrow, go for the classic! At least the cold veggies problem is solved. Overall the beyond burger patty had good chewiness but was very dry. You need a good vehicle of melted cheese and lots of flavorful sauce to enhance the experience. Personally, it doesn't satisfy my meat craving, nor was it better than veggie patties I get from Trader Joe's or the classic Indonesian seitan. P.S. the burger shrank from day 1. I can eat 1.5 of them or even 2. Went with my friends for dinner round 2 cos it was just not satisfying. And everyone was so desperate for a drink, why? There's not supposed to be any MSG in the patty!!!  Food truck ends 8pm on 18 Aug. beyond burgers will be going for $25 from Monday at the Mezza9. #futureofprotein #futureoffood #grandhyattsg #mezza9 #plantbasedburger #alternativeprotein #drklingeats #istillprefermeat #mockmeat2.0 #wheredoesyourfoodcomefrom #grandhyattsg #mezza9sg"
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,1,"I took the long hike to meet friends here having started off at the Martini Bar for happy hour drinks first. The food was delicious and much needed to soak up the preceding wine and cocktails. I was surprised at how expensive the oysters were, but this is Singapore after all. Food was faultless and on cue. The salmon and greens were cooked to perfection. I loved the open-planned kitchen and of course, the Penfolds wine display! I think I tried some wine too, though this was nudging me closer to my threshold for the night. Dessert was gorgeous and I left well and truly filled and sated."
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,-1,"I went for their lunch sets because with your UOB card, there's a 1-for-1 deal. (It's specific to the card type I think, you should check before heading there.) For a fairly reasonable price, you can indulge in a 3 course meal at lunch with coffee/tea thrown in at the end!The bread they served was pretty good - possibly a ciabatta, with a roasted capsicum/pepper dip. I had the sashimi salad, market roasted fish, and tart of the day. The sashimi salad was alright - it was a little too salty from the amount of soy sauce they dumped on it but was otherwise very generous with the raw fish. The market roasted fish was beautifully cooked but was extremely tiny! Just one slice of fish (I had snapper when I was there) with a couple of vegetables. I originally intended to just have 2 courses but it was so small, I was forced to order dessert. The day I was at Mezza9, their tart of the day was pear. While the ice cream served with it was dismal (strange vanilla flavor, creamy but eh), the tart was actually pretty good. The pastry was nice and crumbly, and it wasn't too sweet overall.I'd go back for their 1 for 1 deal, but otherwise don't really see the point of spending all that money here."
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,1,"The champagne brunch on Sundays is fabulous! Definitely book in advance - every table was full. It was $125/person with tax & service charge, which sounds crazy but it is worth every penny. This includes unlimited Perrier-Jouet Grand Brut champagne, which they top up every time you take a couple sips. You could also have bloody marys, mojitos, red or white wine. I'm usually not a fan of buffets as the food doesn't tend to be the best quality, but this one is different - top-notch food that was constantly refreshed. While vegetarians will have less selection than meat eaters, there is definitely more than ample food for everyone's tastes. The buffets included a raw bar of crab claws, oysters, even caviar. The cheese table was exceptional - high quality cheese with accompaniments like quince or honey fresh from the honeycomb. There was a Japanese section with many types of sushi & sashimi (including vegetarian). There was a Chinese/Malay section with dim sum buns, meat on a stick, and many different seafood stir frys. The roast section had many options including wagyu beef sliders. The roasted vegetable sides were also plentiful. You could have eggs made to order. Plus there was a salad bar. And the dessert table went on for days!We sat for 3 hours enjoying countless glasses of champagne and leisurely working our way through all the stations. It was definitely a treat! (And you wont need to eat for the rest of the day)"
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,1,"Strawberry cheesecake ($58/kg) - 5 starsThis is my perfect cheesecake. Not too creamy, it has a bite to it that has the perfect amount of firmness. It's also not so rich that you feel sick eating it, but solid enough that I wouldn't have more than a slice.Blackforest cake ($58/kg) - 5 starsAnother perennial favourite in my family. I've been recommended places like Stuttgart Blackforest Boutique S-Café but have found most blackforest cakes filled with way too much whipped cream (worse still when it's cheap greasy whipped cream). This one is just divine."
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,-1,"The main advantage of this place, which has a vibrant atmosphere, is if people in your party have different culinary preferences, they would probably find what they want here. Otherwise, the food is not as good as what you would find at the equivalent specialist restaurant - whether it is grill, sushi, Thai, Chinese, etc. Service keeps deteriorating; at our last visit, it was downright horrific: One waiter spilled hot water and did not clean the table until requested to do so; another waiter dropped a whole bowl of boiling soup and only provided ice cubes for our guest to cool herself when asked; drinks (iced tea, Diet Coke) came after 20 minutes, a glass of wine never came (in spite of a volunteered promise that it would be free)!! The table was left uncleaned for a long time. At the premium price charged, customers deserve better."
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,1,"The Mezza9 restaurant is a top choice in Singapore. It's not a buffet m restaurant, but they still deliver variety like no other restaurant I know. I love the fact that you have Thai, Chinese, Japanese, grill, seafood++ all at the same restaurant!I believe they have 6 or 7 kitchens. Food recommendations:-lobster bisque -pork skewers-crab cake++"
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,-1,"It's three stars for the food which ranged from stale table bread to fantastic lamb chop.  Presentation was excellent but the flavor hits and misses make it a bit of lottery dining here, depending on what you order. Service was a lot like the food.  Unfortunately our table was served by a generally absent waiter who saw it fit to educate us on the different types of coffee (eg what is a latte!) we can add to our dinner, which the other server had wrongly told us was included in our dinner set.  All in,  I was reminded why this is not a go to place for me."
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,1,"So I made a new friend on Korean Air flight to Singapore.Apparently he was loaded, owning three factories around the world and wanted to treat me and my boyfriend for something special and invited us to this restaurant as he was staying at the hotel.I don't even remember the names of all the food we had but they were nothing like I had eaten before. Soooooo goooood! Foods from every corner of the world, it felt like. The presentation and also the taste. Singaporeans are quite good at making the food looking good. The place was looking fabulous and classy.I tried my first durian here."
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,-1,"I went here for a Sunday brunch and it was quite crowded, many foreigners and many large groups. This is a great place for many types of diners and the restaurant is so large you can easily enjoy a quiet intimate corner for two, a private dining room for a large family, a big round table for a couple of families or any other type of diner.A real drawback, and perhaps it was just for this brunch, but they seem to have squeezed tables into every possible space and even places they shouldn't have, so you were often having to wait to walk through narrow walkways or trying not to bump seated guests while getting around someone getting food. I even saw a table setup at the hostess stand in the front.A big selling point for us was their family friendly atmosphere and they did not disappoint in this area. They have taken one of the above mentioned private dining rooms and turned it into a kids ""camp"" staffed with at least three ""Counselors"" who do a great job interacting with toddlers to teens. This is a free service that allows the adults to relax, talk, enjoy their meals and try many of the different selections. And there are many different types of food to choose from, I've been told that the 9 in their name refers to the nine different kitchens. There is Sushi, Yakitori, general asian, western, seafood, dessert and others I probably missed. Because of their show kitchen concept this isn't a buffet where the food questionably comes out in chafing dishes prepared in the back; this is food being prepared right in front of you and then often being refreshed into the serving dishes as you are taking. The food preparation doesn't get much fresher, especially for a buffet.I think almost everyone should be able to find something to eat, although I didn't see an Indian section or dedicated vegetarian food; and there wasn't a traditional western breakfast items at this brunch, egg station etc...None of us took part in the champagne part of the brunch, but there were bottles popping everywhere and I saw many other drinks, wine, beer and cocktails going by; and they gave us free flow of coffee and soft drinks as well. Often you ask at a buffet for a beer or a soda and you're told it isn't included, it looks like they will serve you any drink you ask for, and your bill will only reflect alcohol or not.Speaking of the bill it is very expensive to dine here, over $135 without alcohol. This wouldn't be a regular weekend activity but for a group with kids this is a great place to get together for a special occasion."
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,1,"Absolutely the best place to go for Martini in Singapore!  They have a huge range of martini on their menu and other drinks too. Their Happy Hours is from 6-9pm, Mondays to Saturdays.  It's always packed so you'll have to go early to get a seat.  Otherwise you'll have to stand around.  Very busy service staff and very friendly and helpful.  I've tried their classic, chocolate and lychee martini.  All great!"
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,1,The only addition I would make to my previous review is to add that the service here from every member of staff is simply wonderful. It is arguably the best service in Singapore.
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,1,"You can be certain that the team at Mezza9 takes their desserts seriously when you discover an exquisite menu devoted wholeheartedly to desserts. Since September last year, this menu featuring five desserts and a cheese platter, has been introduced and adds on to the existing cakes/pastries at the Mezza9 shop. What's better way to indulge in their DESSERT PLATTER ($32++) that offers a taste of everything after a satisfying Italian dinner at Pete's Place! Does this look like a hot piping Souffle? In fact, this is a frozen Grand Marnier Souffle  that is no less potent than the bottle of liquor itself. Every spoonful oozed plenty of boozy goodness that I constantly reminded myself to handle this with extra care to minimize spillage. Much has been raved about the astoundingly creamy home-made ice cream and this mixed pool is no exception. The smooth, rich Papua New Guinea vanilla bean and Manjaro chocolate ice cream sat in contrast with the eye-poppingly tart Passionfruit sherbet and zesty raspberry sherbet, creating quite an exciting taste experience that would appease gelato and sherbet fans at the same time. There is a bonus that is not as showy as the curvy nut tuile perched at the top--bitter cacao nibs inside the intense chocolate gelato. Mezza 9 Deconstructed Pavlova ($16++ for ala carte) The cloud-like crispy baked meringues were taken down a notch on sweetness with the sourish kick from the sherbet and berries. Dessert flower pots are no longer any novelty but the Flower Pot ($16++ for ala carte) here is probably one of the better ones in town. It is not spammed with mousse or any cheese cake but a superbly executed caramel sea salt ice cream that enrobed the palates with toasty notes of burnt sugar. To be more precise, the caramel flavour was perfect, something that very few can mastered well (most are either overdone or underdone). Besides the flower pot, the Grand Cru Chocolate Mousse ($16++ ala carte) is my another favourite in this platter. After all the bright flavours, this chocolate jar proved to be a pleasantly bitter sanctuary that soothes the taste buds. I emptied the entire shooter of dark chocolate sauce and sank myself in the blissful chocolate bed.  A divine finish for the divine desserts"
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,1,"one of my favorite restaurants around. impeccable service along with great food.i love how consistent they are with e service. been here many times and without fail, im always greeted with a smile when i walk in. e attentiveness throughout e whole meal with e wait staff or manager coming around asking how's e food, makes you feel you matter.1. complimentary bread + diplove how e bread is served warm and homemade dip is yummy and makes you wanting for more.2. yu sheng (during festive ""lunar new year"" only)one of e nicer yu sheng i had so far. its served with salmon and kingfisher fish. you can opt for more condiments with extra cost. having e wait staff saying e good wishes for e yusheng in english seems kind of odd but have to give it to them for effort.3. boston lobster eefuu noodle / crispy noodlemy fav dish when im here but seems to be better last time. e one i had that day was kinda bland. this is good for 2-3 to share4. soon hock crispy fishso good you can eat it on its own. fried to perfection. wish i had this at home so i can chew up e whole plate together with e bones. omnomnom factor 10/105. fried nian gao with coconut sherbetthey have this every year during lunar new year! this time i feel it was fried with too much egg but still good nonetheless.  e nian gao and coconut sherbet goes v well together.easter egg for y'all who is reading this review. e deli have e best double chocolate chip cookie i ever had. thumbs up."
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,-1,"I completely do not get the previous reviews of this restaurant. Conveniently located in the Hyatt hotel, this restaurant, while elegant in decor, does nothing much to dissuade me from my prejudice against hotel restaurants. I sat at the chef's bar, which certainly has its own unique level of ambiance. However, the service was very inattentive, nothing close to the reception one should receive when paying these kinds of prices for food in Singapore. I'm fully willing to concede that this lack of service was primarily due to me sitting at the chef's bar and being by myself, but that doesn't entice me to ever return. In terms of the food, I had the grilled fish market selection of the day, which was a tuna steak. Nothing to write home about - not bad, but not anywhere close to the best I've had. This is served a la carte style, so I also ordered the Chinese broccoli to accompany. Again, decent but not great. The best part of the meal was the glass of Pinot. Excellent choice there."
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,1,"Been here on two occasions - but let's start with the food. Normally, the gauge of a good restaurant is how dedicated they are to the number of items on their menu - the fewer, the more concentrated their efforts are to perfecting them - but prepare to spend a good 10 minutes deciding on what you want - they cover all the meats - steak, whole chickens, all kinds of fish, pork, seafood, on the grill, raw, stewed, steamed, fried, blanched, in all forms, shapes, sizes, Asian, Western, or an amalgamation of all the above! Went for the Irish Organic Salmon, fennel, lemon confit 200g ($38) with a side of sautéed spinach with garlic (+$9), and MAN did it pack a punch! The salmon was cooked perfectly to my liking - just slightly orange on the outside and rare and succelent on the inside, so it wouldn't flake to the touch of a fork, and the spinach was gut-wrenchingly beautifully done - so tasty, that a gourmet Popeye would have his eyes popping out just at the smell of it.The selection of wines were also very seductive - from all regions, the obscure ones, the famous ones, the celebrity ones (that can go above $500 a bottle!), Argentinian, Chilean, imported from Bordeau... if you're looking to please someone who's extremely fickle at menus (and you're not sure if a certain place will be the right fit), Mezza9 has all the right things (giving you all the right reasons!) to come here. Did I mention that the restaurant is humungous and the furniture and furnishings, perfect? This is too much for me. Too perfect. :-)"
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,1,"Very consistent bar, food, desserts. Basically that sums it up.I've been visiting Mezza9 at the Grand Hyatt for a few years already but just recently I though again what good concept they have and how a good kitchen and quality management can make all the difference.Service is usually pretty good as well and I never had an issue getting a table here.What I like in particular is that you can order all different varieties of food and not just one particular cuisine. Sometimes you just want to mix and mingle your dinner options...Good spot!"
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,1,"I don't usually eat at hotel restaurants while on vacation however Mezza9 became my go-to spot.  The service is punctual and there were a ton of staff.  Unfortunately there was a bit of a language barrier at times.  The restaurant encompasses a huge open space with open kitchens which creates an interesting energetic atmosphere.The menu is mostly a selection of Chinese, Japanese and Thai favorites with a smattering of western items.  I gravitated toward the Thai menu after hearing one of the chefs is Thai and had probably one of the best beef salads and tom yam kungs I have had anywhere.  Amazingly fresh and flavorful with unmistakeably high quality ingredients.The only downside to Mezza9 is I left Singapore broke.A safe choice if you are in the mood for spending a relaxing night at the hotel, but obviously not the most exciting restaurant in a great city known for an amazing food scene."
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,-1,"Sunday brunch at $138 per person, if you elect not to consume unlimited alcohol, or $168 if you do, provided a fabulous spread, but it's not worth the price. The decor is older, the atmosphere is hotel restaurant and the tables are so close together you find yourself tripping over people both seated and dishing at the serving stations. The food is fresh and cooked pretty much before your very eyes, the various open kitchens provide you with a show of sorts and the children's area is staffed and perfect in allowing parents the ability to enjoy their meal. I started with the raw bar and ate my way through oysters on the half shell and steamed shrimp. I did need a small bath after shelling the shrimp. Sushi was next and, while it was good, it wasn't particularly fresh or imaginative. The ""Western"" beef was rare and delicious while the lamb was cold and filled with fat. The mashed potatoes were excellent along with the green beans. No carrot cake (my absolute favorite) and the pecan tart was okay, but nothing more. I also enjoyed some delicious cheeses. It was a nice experience, but not one I'd sign up for very often. With four more of these ""hotel Sunday brunch"" places in Singapore, I'll need to shop around for a better experience."
Asian Fusion,Mezza9,1,"Mezza 9 is the restaurant in the mezzanine of the Hyatt Hotel. It's a beautiful open kitchen concept with chefs cooking right in front of you. There is Japanese, Chinese and Western cuisine, served mostly family style. The service here is very good and the food is great as well. My favorite thing here though, would have to be their dessert. Try the dessert sampler for two (which is really more like for 4?) which is a platter of about six different types of desserts. Make sure to leave room for this! The restaurant also has a small shop that sells truffles, some pastries and cakes and kitchen and home wear. Check out the attached Martini Bar which serves some of the best martinis in Singapore."
Chinese,Min Jiang At One-North,1,"Had a great lunch for three, roughly $150 altogether. Has a nice formal ambiance for discussions and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly, coming to periodically pour tea and provide clean plates for us. Started with peking duck, which was sliced in front of us and the served with pancakes and a variety of accoutrements, with the waiter offering to show us how to prepare the pancakes (never had a waiter offer that before). Afterwards we were treated to a second course of minced duck and vegetables, wrapped in lettuce, as part of the second course of the peking duck ordering.We also had seafood tofu (some of the nicest tofu I've ever had, nice and tender) and beef hor fun. Dessert was a delightful mango pudding.The quality of the food and atmosphere was fantastic, and was quite reasonable considering the price.As others have mentioned, it's tucked away in Rochester Park, which is a delightful strip in close proximity to Star Vista mall, Park Avenue Rochester hotel, the Biopolis and the Buona Vista MRT station."
Chinese,Min Jiang At One-North,1,"Although the duck is not sliced perfectly, this is the only decent place for beijing duck so far I've found in sg (Been living in Beijing for 5 years before came to Singapore). Other than this, other dishes I've tried are quite tasty and delicate.Lovely place and excellent service when they're not that busy - if you see almost every table occupied, don't expect their response/food too quick; but except that, their service was always considerate and warm."
Chinese,Min Jiang At One-North,1,Excellent duck and fixed price Hairy crab dinner!  The service was great & our group had a private room upstairs. There was something for everyone's taste whether spicy or not.
Chinese,Min Jiang At One-North,-1,Had an afternoon lunch with family. Surprised to see that the building was starting to show wear and tear. Needs to do with some maintenance. The crowd was sparse. Food was average for the price. Went for the regular dim sum selections. On average nothing outstanding. Although the Yang Zhou fried rice was quite well done. Could detect a whiff of wok hei.Didn't try their specialty Peking duck. Perhaps next time. Service was great by one of the staff. Very accommodating. Didn't catch her name though.
Chinese,Min Jiang At One-North,1,excellent duckvery charming placeordered the duck and it perfectly cookedservice was goodstaff was very attentive
Asian Fusion,New Lucky Claypot Rice,1,"I have already been a ""regular"" here before I knew of Yelp, and when they were at Clementi before shifting to Commonwealth before shifting to its current location at Holland Village.The clay pot chicken rice is not just good, it's great! And the price is not too steep either! For about $5/pax, you can get a nice steaming pot of clay pot cooked over a legit charcoal oven (most food these days are cooked over gas stove), filled with salted fish, pork sausage and chicken. The plethora of flavors make this a really tasty dish (for halal customers you can also ask for the pork sausage to be removed). Rice is soft, chicken pieces are tender and the salted fish really adds a whole new dimension.Furthermore, you get to decide how much oil and black sauce to add. Usually I would add until about 90% of the rice grains are black (my stirring sucks, sadly), and oil until the grains are shiny enough. Yes, this sounds unhealthy, but once in a while dish, it's worth it!And usually, we would add some soup as a side. I recommend watercress soup.Note that the food centre is like almost entirely closed save for this stall at night, so seats are aplenty. And yes, like what the other reviewers have mentioned, call in advance to place your order, so you don't have to subject yourself to a 1.5hr wait. This is one of those stalls I would recommend to my friends, and it's also pretty accessible too!"
Asian Fusion,New Lucky Claypot Rice,1,"A simple dish, rice is topped with marinated chicken and Chinese sausages, cooked in a claypot over a charcoal flame which imparts it with a oh-so-good smoky flavour. The stall also sells vegetable and soup side dishes that go well with the claypot rice, making the meal more balanced.Most shops don't bother cooking over a charcoal flame these days due to the time and effort required, so this was a rare treat. Of course the downside is that it will take longer for your food to be prepared. So be wise and follow the advise of previous reviewers and call in your order in advance!"
Asian Fusion,New Lucky Claypot Rice,1,"First things first: ignore the earlier advice that tells you to call 45 minutes in advance; just call at least 1.5 hours ahead and tell them what time you want the food to be ready. Food's really got the ""burnt rice"" taste, which is what you are here for right? Not expensive, but we could have done with more generous portions of chicken and sausages. You can top-up for that. Chicken was nice and tender. Soup was a little salty, and definitely not the best I've had."
Asian Fusion,New Lucky Claypot Rice,-1,"I've been coming here since they were located in Clementi. It's one of those places that you think of and actually go to when you feel like something in particular, even if it's not great, it can always be counted on to deliver a pretty good rendition.In this case they specialize in claypot chicken rice. The taste of charcoal gives it a nice depth, which is my favourite part of any claypot rice. The soups are also quite good.Now that I know where they have moved to, I'll definitely check it out again when I crave claypot rice next."
Asian Fusion,New Lucky Claypot Rice,-1,"The thing about New Lucky claypot is that I associate it quite a bit with my childhood. I used to stay in Clementi when I was much younger and claypot rice for dinner was always a bi-weekly affair. Then I moved away and made my way back again when I was in university, only because of the proximity. Don't get me wrong, the claypot rice is actually pretty good in my opinion.  The stall still sticks to using charcoal for their cooking and this gives the final dish a nice smoky flavour. One thing I love is the little salted fish bits that they put inside the rice along with the chicken and sausage slices - there are others who think of them as nothing more than little balls of salt but I beg to differ.Part of the fun of going to New Lucky is being able to decide how much sauce goes into your dish. At the start of the meal, you are given two metal cups - one filled with dark sauce, the other with fragrant oil. And, they leave it entirely up to you how much you want to put into your rice. I have had an instance where this went horribly wrong and I ended up having to eat rich swimming in oil thanks to a friend's horrible estimation skills. So remember to leave the flavouring to someone trustworthy!"
Asian Fusion,New Lucky Claypot Rice,-1,"New Lucky Claypot Rice was previously located right opposite Clementi central, but recently shifted to the Holland Food Centre, nearby Buona Vista MRT Station. I've always heard about how this claypot rice served with chicken was one of the best in Singapore, so I decided to give it a try once. While it is true that they are one of the rare stalls in Singapore still making use of charcoal to cook their rice, I don't find it to be as mind-blowing as some describe it to be. One good point however is how they add small pieces of salted fish to flavour the rice - which is not done by all stalls selling this dish. However the rice itself may or may not be too dry for my taste, and it is this inconsistency that I have a love-hate thing with. But to have it cooked for us true-blue Singaporean style with real charcoal is a great experience. Another plus point is that they serve various home-cooked soups as well. Try getting the lotus soup or black chicken soup to soothe your throat after a heaty meal like claypot rice - especially if you like the burnt rice portions like me!"
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,"Value for price? Amazing! For $3 you get a medium-sized portion of tasty fried kway teow. You will have to wait for around 30-40 minutes during the lunch hour, but it is worth it. The stall is sort of hit or miss in terms of the portion size, but generally you get enough for a small-ish lunch--I was certainly satisfied. If you're with a group send multiple people out to scout for seating while you wait in line. The stall aunty will come down the line to collect your order and payment and you will pick up your portions immediately as you get to the front of the line."
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,"I hardly eat char kway teow and the one that is stuck in my memory is from the early 90s when I was still a kid and the price was $1 a plate (slowly creeping up to $1.20, $1.50, $2 etc). On this trip back to Singapore I made it a quest to find a good char kway teow and this plate was pretty awesome. It has lots of hums (cockles) and bits of crispy pork lard. It is not too wet or dry. Unfortunately it does not have much of a wok hei flavor. Plus there is no lup cheong (Chinese sausage). But this is definitely a wow if you are a cockle lover. The queue is not very long at 1030am on weekdays, maybe about 10-15 mins wait."
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,-1,"Is this what they called the best in Singapore??? Totally soggy and all clumps together. Cannot taste any fried taste, more like boiled only. The Long queue probably due to the good amount for the price. For the amount, one more star.Overly rated. Not worth the wait. Cannot even tastes the pork cracklings. No Chinese sausages Nor fish cake."
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,"A bit of redemption on our most recent visit here for a place that is well-known for their fried kway teow, but failed to impress us the first time around. Same crazy line at the hawker center, same guy behind the wok, but something different I tasted this time around. Pork cracklins! I'm pretty positive this is something new added as I think I would have remembered tasting it before. Overall, the fried kway teow was quite delicious and didn't have that fishy aroma I remembered last time even though the cockles were aplenty in our dishes. The line was definitely worth it this go around."
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,-1,Add cockles for $1 sgdFried  kway teow mee $3 sgdThe noodle was good but saturated too much in sauceThe cockles were ok but not quiet fresh tasting completely Open 6am to 4pmLocated in food court upstairs Singapore hawker masters 2010 winnerRecommend to bring cash and napkins
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,"The secret is the pork lard.One of the best, not the best. I like this version of sweet char kway tiao for the longest time. And the secret is the crunchy pork lard. The chilli can be better so that keeps me from giving the fifth Star.Eat it when it's hot, that's the best flavor!"
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,"due to some serious jetlag, me and justin b. were wide awake early in the morning and since Outram Park opens at 6am, we were there first thing for a breakfast of fried kway teow haha. at about $2-3 USD, this is a great value for a great meal. there was absolutely no line at 6am and we actually might have been the first customers of the day haha. the noodles are cooked fresh for you and it was a delicious way to start my day. lots of good flavors and texture to this dish - you've got some crunch, diff types of noodles, and a slight spice kick. so good!"
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,"Very good char kuey teow. Good char on the noodles , lots of garlic - tasty indeed. A good serving of cockles for those who like it."
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,"Breakfast of champions: char tway teow with teh o'ais limau. I am totally addicted to char kway teow and eat as much of it as I can when I'm Singapore or Malaysia, so I was pretty excited that I could get some of the good stuff as early as 6am. Filled with delicious crunchy pork lard and rice noodles, it's not exactly a healthy start to the day, but damn it's good. I came early in the day and it wasn't too busy, so the kway teow mee was served fast and fresh for just $3. I shared it with my partner and with the heat that had already kicked in, was enough to keep us going until lunch (though I could have easily smashed one to myself without hesitation!).The cockles are very fishy, so if that isn't your thing I would recommend ordering without it. We opted for extra chilli and it was well spiced. Definitely a dish I will be missing at home and having been to Penang the day after this visit, can say it's right up there as one of the better noodle dishes I had on this trip."
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,"Definitely the best char kway teow in Singapore. I usually avoid going 11:30am to 2:30pm. The wait time is crazy.Very simple. Cockles, noodles, bean sprouts, lots of garlic and lard. No Chinese sausage or fish cakes. I get mine with $2 extra cockles, fried white with extra chili.RTE whenever I'm in Singapore."
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,"so where do you get char kway teow at 6am in the morning?here la!truth be told, i've not had a plate of char kway teow for ages!but somehow, army food just makes you crave what you cant get inside.since it's early in the morning, there isnt a queue.order, pay and be seated.they will deliver to your table even though it says self-service, i guess only when they arent busy.my previous complains about them is that their version tends to be too dry.but today it was very much to my liking.together with nicely cooked(not under and not over) cockles(albeit a little small).every now and then you also get a delightful crunch of crispy pork lard!breakfast of champions?"
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,Great kway teow for only 3 dollars. Make sure you get extra egg!
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,First time I've ever tried char kway teow. Quite delicious. I got mine with spice which made this dish extra special. You can choose to have your dish with or without cockles (blood clams). I did both. Cockles have a very potent taste. Too potent... and I generally love extreme tastes. This preparation includes small bits of crispy pork skin for even more kick. Enjoy!
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,-1,"I think the saying goes, ""you eat with your eyes first.""  Unfortunately, fried kway teow is not a pretty looking dish with its brownish, grayish color, noodles all jumbled together forming an indistinguishable pile of stuff.  But, my first and, so far, only encounter with this dish wasn't that bad; I expected as much given the line that snaked through the food court when we arrived.  When we made it to the front, we could see the the chef--a one man noodle frying machine churning out dish after dish of fried kway teow.  His shirt was soaked and beads of sweat trickled down his brow over his face.  I found his quickness impressive, but I couldn't help thinking of the possibility of a stray droplet of sweat making its way into our dish.  It was a good sized serving of the fried noodles.  A thick sauce coated the noodles, making everything the same color so I couldn't tell what yummy little bits were contained in my chopstick-full of noodles.  The cockles were a chewy surprise, though there were some pieces that had cockle intestines oozing out; I just gave those pieces to the mister.  Overall, a yummy, interesting dish that I wouldn't hesitate to try again."
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,"This is hands down, the BEST char kway teow you can get in Singapore. It's almost an institution and you cannot say you've had char kway teow until you have eaten here. Waiting times can get insane, especially during lunch hour, and waits of up to 45mins are really common. The old chef is a master at what he does, and he cooks it non-stop till the crowds begin to dissipate near the end of lunch hour before taking a break and closing. The pricing is insane as well, for the incredible standard of the char kway teow served - $3 for the standard serving, $1 extra for more cockles, 50c for more egg. Guaranteed to leave you wanting more."
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,"I'm a huge fan of char kway tiao; it's no doubt really sinful but I just can't resist the smooth pieces of kway tiao and the pork lard. The char kway teow here was moist but not overly greasy. Just the right amount of sweet dark sauce to accent the savoriness, yet not overpowering it, and plenty of wok hei. Finally, the spicy chili gave this simple hawker dish just that bit of oomph. The Ingredients included the usual beansprouts, cockles, fish cake and pork lard. Most notable was, of course, the succulent cockles and ultra-crispy pork lard. Overall, definitely one of the best char kway tiao that I have eaten, and no doubt very highly recommended!"
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,It's one of the best if not the best Char Kway Teow in Singapore.  It's done the Singapore style i.e. a bit wet.  The cockles is done just right ..... al dente!  Long queue is to be expected but definitely less than an hour.  Very affordable pricing.  A $3 plate is usually sufficient for me!
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,"Soooooo tasty. Best Char Kway Teow in the country, for realz. Long lines during lunch. You'll be hard-pressed to find a table anywhere, but take it to go and huddle in some park around just gobble up the goodness. Just do it"
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,"The crowds at Hong Lim Complex FC can get insane, and it pays to go there a little early for the good stuff. Found this place upstairs and towards the middle of the unusually shaped hawker centre. They serve char kway teow and that is all. $3 for the standard serving, $1 extra for more cockles, 50c for more egg. The cook had just finished the last batch when I arrived, so I got to watch him work, and he is a master at it.He deserves 9.5/10 for the food, but I had to round down for the lack of sliced pork. Otherwise, everything was fantastic and delicious. If you are in the area, stand in line, watch the master work, then savor his art."
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,"Get the extra egg and cockles! You deserve it after waiting on the line. The closest thing to Penang char kway teow that I've ever found in Singapore, imho. The addition of the crispy pork nicely disguised in all the mess in the plate was definitely genius!"
Noodles,Outram Park Fried Kway Teow,1,The best Kway Teow I have had ever.  Not oily like most places.  My 7 year old daughter loved it without the chilli or cockles.
Chinese,Pin Wei Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,1,"A must stop for me if I ever have a chance to visit Singapore again! The chee cheong fun were so tasty, they brought back all the wonderful childhood memories that I had when it came to this type of food. I love all the different meats or just the plain ones with soy sauce."
Chinese,Pin Wei Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,1,"This is fresh, silky goodness, hand made to order when you order. Go with the prawn or plain chee cheong fun. I found the char siu average and the scallop chewy. Havent tried the abalone. The wait can be long since everything is made a la minute, but you can spend the time looking at all 20 photos of chow yun fat posing with the proprietors.(Apparently, they didnt want to take his money when they saw him but he insisted)One of the best chee cheong funs in sg. Chow yun fat might even agree!"
Chinese,Pin Wei Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,1,They only do one type dish here- the only choice you have is what type of meat you want in it-but they do it to perfection! Highly recommended.
Chinese,Pin Wei Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,1,"Worth the wait! The rice rolls are nice and thin, the shrimp is plump and moist and the BBQ pork is finely chopped. Prices are on point."
Chinese,Pin Wei Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,1,"if any stall can define pek kio food centre then Pin Wei is it!even the business photo for the food centre shows a plate of Pin Wei's craftsmanship!a customized JIT set up with 2 identically rectangular flat steamers lying alongside another similarly sized, greased, flat work surface where a liquid rice mixture flows in from one end onto muslin cloths lining the steamers, gets subjected to the laws of science regarding a change of physical state then undressed by being separated from it's host clothing to reveal a slippery smooth, silky thin cheong fun before being rolled to give extra depth or in cases where foreign objects such as char siew, prawns, scallops or abalone were introduced, to provide a seductively sheer yet protective layer for them foreign talent, then cut up into bite sizes as it emerges at the other end of this continuous work flow, minimally moisturized with a slightly sweet light soy sauce, fragrantly peppered with sesame seeds and further spiced up, as you deem fit, with homemade chilli.this, is a precision assembly line that will meet ISO 9001 standards at hawker prices.this, is a master handcrafted product that will gluttonously glide down your throat to your eagerly awaiting bellies.this, is satisfaction guaranteed or your money .........................  is out of pocket!:)"
Chinese,Pin Wei Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,1,"If I am ever in Pek Kio, fretting over the long lines at Wah Kee Prawn Noodles, we will always order this chee cheong fun.The chee chong fun are made on the spot when you order, and it is like those served in HK dimsum restaurants. These are thin and soft, either plain, with char siew, or shrimps, or scallops or abalone.I actually like the plain ones as they comes with a good sesame oil/soy sauce mixture which is really yummy. Shrimps one comes a second for me."
Chinese,Pin Wei Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,1,"Extremely tasty and soft, fresh -- unlike any you are likely to find in a restaurant.   A must go to have...."
Chinese,Roland,1,"Impeccable service and delicious food. Roland and his team elevate the Singapore seafood dining experience. Conveniently located on the East Coast on the top floor of the parking garage next to the Marine Parade NTUC Fair Price, dine on local favourites like chili and pepper crab, crunchy baby squid and stuffed dough sticks (yew char kway). First, the nosh. I enjoyed the flavourful boiled peanuts with black bean and sesame tones offered instead of the usual roasted kachang (roasted peanuts). They asked if we wanted tea. (Tip: They do not have chrysanthemum tea.) We decided to stay with water instead. They brought out an extensive menu filled with Chinese seafood dishes that I grew up with when I used to visit Seafood Road on East Coast Road (Long Beach, Palm Beach, Redhouse, nearby Golden Lion). I was transported back in time. They have lovely pictures in the menu that helped with my decision-making process. We ordered two large male crabs: chili crab and pepper crab, market price was $72 per kilogram. It was more than $10 less that the market price at restaurants at the East Coast Seafood Center. The chili crab sauce was to die for. We sopped it up with fried and steamed mantou (slightly sweet bread). The black pepper crab was tasty. The crab meat was sweet and tender, but I have had crab that was fatter and more meat. However, it could've been a seasonal thing. They might've just finished moulting.  The fried baby squid was heavenly. These half inch long morsels are sweet and savouring, serving up a distinct flavour and crunch. I felt sad that I didn't eat another plateful. Try it with a red chili sauce. Sweet and heat, Bobby Flay would've been proud.Another dish that had the sweet and heat thing going on was the fish paste stuffed fried dough stick (stuffed yew char kway). These come out hot and crispy. The fish paste was delicious. Dip it into the sweet flour and chili sauce that was hmmm, so good. My daughter licked it clean. They'd probably given us more sauce of we'd asked.Our last course was fried rice with tiny silver fish and crab. This dish was full of texture. I loved the crispiness of the fried fish that made the dish pop. I thought the crab was a little lost in the dish, but I enjoyed two bowls of it. I enjoyed eating it was a lightly seasoned plate of kailan greens.Just went I thought I could eat no more, they brought out orh nee, a traditional Teochew dessert or sweet taro paste. Unlike other orh nees that is sticky and oily, Roland's rendition is lighter and smoother, still maintaining its characteristic sweetness and slightly floral notes. My daughter enjoyed the light mango pudding with pomelo. That capped the evening on the highest note. It is one of the loveliest mango concoctions I have ever tasted. My daughter shyly asked for another round.While thinking about the food again makes me salivate, what sets Roland's apart is their service. When we made inquiries about the menu, the staff were friendly and hospitable, taking the time to go to the kitchen to answer our questions. When we made our reservations over the phone, they continued their extend their warm hospitality. Upon arrival, the maitre d' had our reservation on her list, then ushered us to a beautifully set smaller round tables. Roland's is a fantastic place to hold a banquet. The beautiful dining room is beautifully decorated with mirrors and lit low. The lights in the tanks added ambiance. Also, the restaurant is quieter than typical Chinese restaurants and conducive to conversations. The waitstaff were so attentive throughout the meal that I almost felt like I was at a French restaurant. Okay, I exaggerate a little, but still, they were super attentive and accommodating. It was a little surreal to be attended so closely while peeling and sucking on crab shells at the same time. However, I got over it very quickly. We couldn't finish our orh nee, and the wait staff quickly offered to package it home in a doggie bag for us. We all enjoyed our dining experience.Try Roland's for classy and comfortable way to enjoy Singapore seafood!"
Chinese,Roland,1,"Singapore is know for many things, chili crab being one! Roland is a Singapore institution that is popular amongst the locals.As others have said, compared to other places, Roland's crab is more ""spicy"" than sweet, catering to a more authentic taste than other places that tend to have more of a tourist crowd. That said, I really enjoyed the chili crab and the group I was with ordered another!The atmosphere is nice - it's not overdone and you feel that you're in a ""Chili Crab""/Asian restaurant rather than some tourist joint. it's hard to describe, but once you look at the photos you'll understand. It has a really strong family vibe and, if you come late enough, you might be lucky to hear terrible Cantonese/Mandarin karaoke next door which only makes the experience feel more authentic!English is a bit hit and miss with some of the staff but it's manageable."
Chinese,Roland,1,"Roland is the FOUNDER of Singapore's famous Chilli Crab. It's hard to imagine that this is indeed the case when you have other more known establishments such as Jumbo Restaurant, No Signboard Seafood, and Long Beach Seafood spread across the Red Dot. Make no mistake about it, however, this is one of the BEST places to grab Chilli Crab in Singapore. Located on top of a parking lot!?!? This is where the locals, particularly those who live in the East, get their Chilli crab. In terms of the Chilli Crab itself, I'll second what a fellow Yelper said in her review. Roland delivers a Chilli Crab that is more chilli than sweet, the way it ought to be done. Many restaurants cook their Chilli Crab in order to cater to a foreigners' sweet tooth (ahem, Jumbo). I wouldn't say the dish is spicy, but it did have some kick resulting a little bit of sweat coming down my forehead. :DThe other dishes were solid. The Baby Kai Lan was absolutely delicious, while the Seafood Food Fried Rice came up way short (I wasn't a big fan of the crunchy like topping they sprinkled on the Fried Rice).Overall, if you are a big fan of Chilli Crab, Roland is a must try!"
Chinese,Roland,1,"I have always wanted to try the Chilli crab that started all Chilli crabs but no chance till now! My best friends returned home from overseas and demanded to fulfill their Chilli crabs need. So I suggested to try Roland Restaurant, I mean they DID claim that they are the originator!! As the star dish of the night, I must say that their Chilli crab is indeed better than most I have eaten. This is because many restaurants cater to foreigners' taste buds and scale down their Chilli-ness to tomato sweet. Their sauce is thick with a hint of tomato sweet and yet still packed with even Chilli punch! Awesome!!!! The crabs themselves were fresh and meat was juicy and firm. Another star of the night has to be the Salted Egg Crab with yam. It's really salted egg sauce that's fried into the crab and they tossed in some yam fritters to give the dish extra crispiness, crunch and flavor!!! We had many other dishes and all beautifully done. As my best friend said at the end of the meal, ""Roland knows how to do it right"". The meal is not cheap but we had Sea Bass and drunken prawns and Broccoli with Scallops so it's rather worth the cost. Definitely bringing my family to try."
Chinese,Roland,1,"Wah. The customer service here is really crazy. By crazy I mean good crazy. They are so attentive to clear your plates and top up your tea, but its not like I feel them hovering around my table all the time and spying on me.Probably they have some CCTV somewhere to secretly monitor our dining? Hahaha. Got crab and kai lan. Both were ridiculously delicious. But the calories should be insane since they put so much ingredients into the crab.Only caveat is that it's kinda ex.. But oh wells..."
Chinese,Roland,1,"Very tasty chilli crab, it is 800 gr and good for two person. (55 Sin. Dol.) Crispy noodles with prawns is also very good and really tasty. I will try there dim sum also during noon time."
Chinese,Roland,1,The restaurant is an institution in this island nation and they are the original creators of Singapore's famous Chilli Crabs! A must try for all seafood lovers! And good value for money!The restaurant is simply decorated but most diner are there concerned only with the excellent food that they serve and not the decor. They have an extensive menu that is sure to satisfy most! So if you're visiting Singapore and looking for a great meal this is one restaurant that you cannot afford to miss!!
Chinese,Roland,1,The best chili crabs i have ever eaten! There is thus black sauce prawns dish that simply delectable! I have tried their other crab dishes and i have to say they are really so delicious too!
Chinese,Roland,1,A big restaurant perfect for families and large groups. Very sweet chilli crab for S$60 per kg. We took some veggies and fried baby squid as side dishes. Although the chilli crab is a bit expensive it is worth its money. The sauce was very nice to add with steamed rice and the buns.
Chinese,Roland,1,"Pretty good, comparable Chinese food back home, even though I was here for a baby's one month lunch buffet celebration, impressed w/ the noodles, pan-fried shrimp, stuffed tofu, and the chicken.Apparently known for its seafood & crab, not exactly the food of choice with babies and kids running around.Dessert pudding with the tapioca, was average since I prefer this more of a jello-feel, as this one's more of a soup.Massive restaurant, easily 300 seats, with plenty of private room action.Service quite impressive, as they topped up our glasses.One minor criticism is its lighting, not exactly the brightest."
Chinese,Roland,1,"I'll keep this review simple. As expected, the chili crab is excellent, and you should definitely order some fried mantous to soak up the sauce. The attire is casual, and you should probably wear some old clothing you don't care about getting messy. Alternatively, you and your friends can wear white t-shirts and use each other as napkins."
Chinese,Roland,1,"I came here with my classmates and everyone of us enjoyed the place and its food. We ordered the duck, black pepper crab, longevity noodles, Golden Beancurd, Teochew Steamed Seabass. I hope that my classmates and I can have a reunion here sometime into the future!"
Chinese,Roland,1,"Picture yourself sinking your teeth into juicy, succulent and flavourful steaming crab flesh imbued with spices, and then swabbing the thick chilli gravy with chewy fried mantous (deep fried buns). The star dish for Singaporean cuisine lands at a respectable 35th position in CNN's World's Top 50 Most Delicious Foods (ousting his yummy cousin, the chicken rice, by 10 spots). If you're out for a big treat, Roland's the place to go!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"That hit all the right spots! Savory, sour, spicy, and slightly sweet. Standard soup that accompanies the bak chor mee. Comes with fish balls, dumplings, and seaweed.Get there early to beat the long lines. One of the most popular bak chor mee in Singapore."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"If you are craving for Bak Chor mee, this is a good place to go to. The $6 portion has all the ingredients - minced and sliced pork, beef balls and fried ti poh (fried sole fish). The sauce is a nice blend of soya, chili and vinegar.This stall at Hong Lim is run by the nephew of the Michelin-starred Tai Hwa at Crawford Lane. The queue is definitely shorter at this branch."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"My favourite bak chor mee in Singapore! (but... I haven't tried the one at Crawford Lane) I've eaten here quite a few times (when the BCM craving strikes, approx once every 3 weeks) and the quality of the food has always been consistent.Nice, springy noodles (go for the mee pok!) with a generous serving of minced pork, pork balls, fried flatfish, dumplings and just the right amount of fried lard. I especially love the fried flatfish, haven't seen it appear in other BCM places. Very salty on its own but goes well with the noodles+vinegar in the dish!However, they don't seem to be open for as long as the other stalls in Hong Lim food center... (have gone at about 7pm only to see that the store was closed :| ) Make sure that you check the opening hours before heading there!"
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,No no no....this is no way close to the one at Crawford street! Don't be fooled by the same name! Some things in life is worth waiting for.
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,1,"I prefer this outlet as compared to the branch at Crawford Lane, the queue here is definitely not as bad. The quality of the noodle is pretty good... love the springy texture and it is loaded with ingredients (dried fried flatfish, pork balls, liver, minced pork, mushrooms and handmade dumplings). You must love vinegar as they are rather generous with it in their noodles.  The soup is rich, meaty and flavorful."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"I was at Hong Lim Market and Food Centre on a Sunday afternoon with the initial intention to eat the famous Outram Char Kway Teow. Unfortunately, the Char Kway Teow Stall was closed for the day, as was the case for many other stalls there as well. My friends and I could not decide what to eat and made our choice the typical Singaporean way - by heading for the stall with the longest queue at Tai Wah Pork NoodlesThere was a queue of at least 7 people in front of us when we started queueing and the wait was long (and excruciating since we were all rather starved). The uncle cooking the noodles is quite old and hence, speed isn't the shop's forte. I have to say that the noodles were cooked to perfection - great texture and very springy, and that sorts of justifies the wait. They are also rather generous with their lard servings so for those who love those crispy pillows of lard, this stall would make you pretty happy. However, the sauce combination used was a bit bland for my taste and hence isn't a favourite of mine."
Noodles,Tai Wah Pork Noodle,-1,"My husband swears by this noodle shop and occasionally tricks me into eating with him.  They have changed locations a couple times but the dish is best at this outlet.   I have to say, it is quite good.  I love the perfectly cooked liver but leave out the meat balls.  Their noodles must be homemade.  I highly recommend it to those who like pork noodle."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,"So thanks to being heavily engaged w/ Yelp, I was basically put in charge of choosing where we eat almost everyday during our 3-week stay.  It was a random evening and we wanted to check the mall out at Orchard before heading out to dinner.  I went w/ 3 of my colleagues... 1 decided to lock herself in the hotel room because she did not want to walk but Jerry and I went and had a blast.Upon walking in, I felt that shorts were not appropriate for this restaurant as I should have been in something dressy/casual.  We did not have a reservations so they seated us upstairs - though the downstairs looked so much nicer.  The menu, our glasses of water, and everything came super fast w/ the exception of when it was time to pay.  We were both hungry so:- crispy chicken- banana leaf wrapped puree fish thingy- beef rendang- the blue ginger (chicken dish)Our meal came w/ pickled vegetables which we both enjoyed.  The crispy chicken was juicy but under-seasoned, the banana leaf thing was a little weird but it was OK (tastes very fishy), the beef rendang was super tender, and the blue ginger was flavorful; you can taste and sense the ginger.  None of the dishes came w/ a base so ordering rice was a must.  Between the 2 of us, we destroyed our heavy dinner. Jerry became my great eating out partner.  Service was friendly and the place was clean and modern.  No complaints."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,-1,"Blue Ginger is an average value Peranakan meal - portions are generally small, but with some fantastic dishes. Glad we went - but not in a hurry to return.Great dishes: * Kueh Pue Tee - delicious and refreshing starter* Beef Rendang - succulent well cooked beef.* Nonya Fishhead Curry - the highlight. Wonderfully aromatic curry broth and fantastic red snapper.* Ayam Panggang Blue Ginger - MUCH better than the Buah Keluak, which was underwhelming."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,"My go-to for immersing my out of town guests in peranakan fare. My stomach loves this place, but my arteries don't. Heavy, hearty fold that I can only embellish in once every three months at most. Go here."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,"Great restaurant for dinner. Nice decorations and atmosphere. We ordered beef rendang and a chicken dish with coconut sauce. Both tasted really good with rice and the pickles served with it. Probably the best food we had during our 5-day stay in Singapore. Drinks were also yummy, try the lime juice ;) very refreshing. Would recommend this to friends as well."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,-1,"My Singaporean friend recommended me this place so we came.  It's my first encounter with Peranakan cuisine and I was told it's a fusion of Chinese and Malay food.  Very cozy and intimate - good for a small group.Portion is small so we were able to try a few dishes.  We had a few appetizers but nothing left a lasting memory.  My friend said I have to try Ayam Buah Keluak at least once - it's unique but can't say it's my favorite.  We also got the Nonya Fish Head Curry because I said I never had it.  I am very sensitive to fish so I can't say I like that one either :(  On the other hand, the Redang was good but I really enjoyed the Udang Masak Assam Gulai.  I think I had a few plates of rice just on that sauce alone.  We finished with some chendol, without the durian :P  I can't say I want this as my last meal on earth but it was a pretty good experience."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,"My personal culinary highlight on a trip to Singapore. The Nonya Fishhead Curry was the best fish curry I ever had - incredibly tasty, nicely arranged: a treasure for the eye and the palate."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,"My first intro to Peranakan cuisine was at Blue Ginger many moons ago.  And I always make a point to return to this place everytime I'm in SG.  Peranakan food is a melange of Chinese and Malay food, derived from the Penang and Malacca region of Malaysia.  On to the important stuff.  My favorite item from here is a chicken stew made with the Buah Keluak, which is a relative of the betel nut.  The nut is apparently poisonous but after  many hours of preparation and fermentation,  it yields a very smoky, bitter taste.  It's cooked with various spices like turmeric and galangal.  I also love the beef rendang, a curry made with coconut milk, turmeric and lemongrass.   I've had my share of beef rendang, far and wide, but I still prefer the rendang from Blue Ginger.  The meat is tender.    The spices are subtle but pungent at the same time.For dessert, I can't say enough about the durian chendol.  It's a dessert made with crushed ice, pandan jelly noodles, coconut milk, durian puree.  Think distant relative of Filipino halo halo or Vietnamese che.  It's a lovely cool down from all the spices of the entrees.Blue Ginger is gentrified, I must admit.  White table cloth.  Great service.   Cozy and intimate.  It's made for tourists like me.  And I love it, every time.If you are curious about Peranakan cuisine:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe"
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,"I do overall like this place but I think I would only come here once in awhile. My sister introduced me to the very traditional food here, we got: 1) Kwuh pie tee cups - outside was pretty good 2) beef rendang - it was good but a little bland for me 3) tamarind prawns - the best dish I had, love the flavors in this 4) white wine - do not order 5) otta otta - interesting and worth an order Portions are quite small but there is unlimited rice and pickled veggies."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,"I excellent paranakan food, each time I am in Singapore I visit this restaurant and I always enjoy good food and service here."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,"This is a review of a delayed birthday dinner with a friend at The Blue Ginger.  This is an update to a previous review.  Since, with  the exception of kueh pie tee, I had completely different dishes this time, I thought it was worthwhile to write a new review.Plus, the second  time around, my overall experience was more consistently  positive.Obviously, the ambiance has not changed.  So, I will mostly pull from my previous review.  I also have now included interior photos .The room is stylish.  There are beautiful accents and warm colours providing the room with a warm and comfortable home-like feel.  It is a pretty small restaurant and the seating can be a touch cramped.  I am relatively large and this doesn't help the situation.tinyurl.com/b3r7c7qtinyurl.com/bh2tzmqAn additional positive (at least for me), is that, on both visits, they were playing Pink Martini.  This is one of my favorite musical groups and not one that I would expect to find playing in a Singaporean restaurant.The service was more consistent than my first visit.  The staff was attentive and very present.  They checked often to insure things were going well.  I also thought the  meal was better paced.  They were all very friendly, polite, and professional.The food ranged from good to extremely good.  The food was also nicely presented.Mixed pickles and sambal belachan are provided on each table.  However, these are not complimentary.  There is a small charge.  The rice is also included in these charges.  Throughout the meal, the rice is served as needed.tinyurl.com/askhol5tinyurl.com/c7j6nqxKueh Pie Tee (Shredded bamboo shoots and turnips garnished with shrimp in pie tee cups) - This was very good.  The cups were perfectly fried and the fillings were fresh.tinyurl.com/bg5v54lNonya Rolls - They were quite delicious.  They were super crunchy.  The yam added a very nice sweetness that typical spring rolls do not have.tinyurl.com/afmeak2Ayam Panggang ""Blue Ginger"" (De-boned chicken thigh and drumstick flavoured with coconut milk rich in exotic spices and grilled) - I am lucky this was one of two great chicken dishes I've had recently.  The chicken was so moist and tender.  The flavours went so well together.  The coconut, dash of heat, and other spices just took this chicken dish over the top.tinyurl.com/cgbkzd3Beef Rendang (Tender beef cubes prepared in rich coconut milk spiced with ginger, lemon-grass, lime leaves and a dash of curry powder) - This is the best rendang I've eaten yet.  Now, I've not had that many.  But this was a very tasty dish.  There was just loads of flavour.  There was a richness and almost a smokiness to the flavours.tinyurl.com/a49u8jdNonya Fish Head Curry (Red snapper with ladies fingers and eggplant cooked in a traditional home-style curry) - The only specific request my friend made was she wanted the fish head curry.  This was my inaugural fish head curry.  I am not sure what I was waiting for.  I have no idea how this stacks up against other fish head curries.  I do know it was extremely good.  The seasonings in the broth were amazing.  The fish was tender and flaky.  Some way, the spices did not overpower the delicate taste of the fish.  The vegetables were crisp.  The okra did not have even a hint of the slipperiness that can so easily develop with okra.  This was just an all around great dish.  Visually, it was also quite appetizing.tinyurl.com/a87tetsReceipt ($102.75):tinyurl.com/c8r7pexOverall, this was a very enjoyable dining experience.  The food was consistently well-prepared with very substantial and well-balanced flavours.  The attentive and friendly service combined with the warm and inviting room to compliment the food perfecty.  In my last review, I was rounding up a bit.  For this visit to The Blue Ginger, I am providing a very solid four star review."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,Peranakan cuisine! Great location so I've been a few times and was happy with the food each time. With this menu I love trying new things i haven't each time though slightly pricey.
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,"For me, this is the best Peranakan restaurant in Singapore.This is one of the restaurant I go to for comfort food. It tastes like home cooking which I love. The quality is consistent and all the dishes I tried there are very tasty.Definitely a place to bring guests visiting Singapore."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,-1,"A friend was visiting so I wanted to take her to a Peranakan restaurant.  My usual favorite Candlenut was fully booked (it was Friday night alas!) so I called Blue Ginger on the recommendation of a Singaporean friend and got us a table.The restaurant is set in a shop house in Tanjong Pagar, a good place to take visitors.  Renovation is simple, and so are the dishes, they have a feeling of home-cooked fare to them - unpretentious, not fancy but delicious, definitely a day-to-day staple.  We ordered the kueh pie tee, the bakwan kepeting (soup made of pork and crab meatball with bamboo shoots), beef rendang, kangkong and a seabass cooked in a spicy tamarind gravy.  I would say everything turns out to be pretty good, just like what fine Peranakan cooking should be and the prices are reasonable and definitely cheaper than Candlenut.  The only complaint I have is the pork and crab meatball with bamboo shoots had somewhat of a pungent smell to it. The food is definitely above average but I would say that it lacks the surprises I get from Candlenut where I feel the presentation of the food and the combination of ingredients and flavors are all perfect.  It is definitely not bad but is also not my go-to place.  Nevertheless, it's a good option considering the lower prices in general."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,"Looking for a 'landing pad' that perfectly encompasses the worldly influences of Singaporean food culture, decades of gritty history, and charming old-world architecture and interior design? Well, this is my definite bet for the perfect place to go (and you can tell, because you will see visitors gathering in large round tables from China and the 'west' grinning from ear to ear, clamouring about the toothsome splendour that is The Blue Ginger). The Beef Rendang is something that is on par with your friendly neighbourhood makcik's best efforts... chunks of beef in a dark maroon gravy (careful! it's so good that you might find yourself licking the plate clean) that's been sitting in a stew enriched with shallots, chilli peppers, lemon grass, turmeric, coconut, and galangal for more than four hours... Servings are larger than at the Grandma's Restaurants on Orchard, where they are puny and never enough, and they come up to about the same price-tag (and taste a LOT better).Other must-orders are the Otak-otak (shiok as hell!), with the lemongrass so freshly potent that your nostrils will be flaring in pleasure, and the Deep-fried Brinjal in Sambal... I'm getting hungry for Blue Ginger all over again!"
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,"i really liked this! perhaps because it was my first foray into peranakan cuisine, or perhaps because of the great company, but i found the food very interesting and different.of particular interest was the buah keluak dish, which has these nuts that are supposedly poisonous unless you cook it the right way. it tasted like a really nutty olive tapenade, and was quite delightful.i also really loved the ngo heong. my first time having this and they were little flavor bombs of awesome wrapped in a lightly crispy wrapper.everything else tasted great, but these 2 in particular stood out. i'm giving it the much coveted xander 5 stars, although i'm not sure how this compares to other peranakan restaurants, since this is my first try."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,"Good quality Nonya restaurant. I was there a few years ago and was so impressed that I went back recently.  There were many local diners on the night so it is a sign that the food is good. Lucky we got there early as I could see them turning away people. It was a bit more expensive that the food centres, but the food was tasty, authentic, the ambient was great, and the service was great."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,"I understand that Blue Ginger may be a bit of an institution for Peranakan cuisine and I can see why. A particularly easy place for Westerners to dine as the menu is varied without being too extensive, and the descriptions are well written with certain items identified as special recommendations. The price level is higher than what you would expect at a 'local joint' but less than those of many of the other 'westernised' eateries' we visit. We enjoyed every dish we ordered, but stand outs were the whole sambal fish, the chicken rolls and the prawns. The whole fish is a little intimidating when it first arrives at the table but just get stuck in! The sweet sambal over the crispy fried skin... dericious! I also am a sucker for sago pudding with gula melaka... not bad here, but the sago had congealed a bit more than necessary and I prefer it without the ice shavings. Service is polite and attentive. Decor is a bit dated (I thought) but in keeping with a traditionalist theme and  far from off-putting. Their wine and beer list could probably be widened a bit more, especially wine by the glass. We spent $60 per person for starters, mains and two drinks each. I think this is a great place to bring visitors to give them a taste of peranakan cuisine. Next I want to try Peranaman and then off to Melaka for the graduation of peranakan cuisine!"
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,-1,"Good flavours on non-veg dishes. Nice pickles to snack on. Veg mains - limited options and flavourless. Applicable for lunch and dinner not a breakfast or brunch place. Gets quite busy during lunch / dinner, need to book in advance.If anything try the oyster sauce main next time."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,-1,"Wonderfully decorated dining room and great air conditioning! Food is unique fusion -- not all the flavors worked for us -- very strong fishy tastes on some items made them almost inedible. Service was unhurried but efficient -- but we found ourselves looking for the waiter because the pauses were long. Worth a visit if you are looking to try something different, but, thinking back, there are many other worthy restaurants in the same neighborhood, so I'd skip it next time -- not on the ""must visit"" list at all."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,the food is quite authentic peranakan and worth a try especially with big groups but the seating area is quite tight and squeezy. I must say that the kueh pie tee is one of the best I have ever had. The portions are just nice that it fits into the mouth comfortably in one go and melts neatly into your mouth in one superb food orgasm.Everything else is spicy spicy spicy and the dessert sweet sweet sweet. Didn't help that our group had a diabetic and needed something not sweet. Not much options for him there. Not even fruits. So don't bring any diabetic friends and relatives there.
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,-1,"Not honest. Overcharged by 25% expecting us not to notice because we were a large party. They clearly added on a bunch of drinks that we did not order and did so as the meal progressed. Also, people seemed to get sick the next day. The fish dishes were larger than expected the food was otherwise ok."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,"Even though I was only passing through Singapore for a few days, I will be damned if I was not going to get any Peranakan food.  This place is very Ang Moh friendly, if you are afraid to attack the hawker centres.  There were three of us and we tried to eat everything that we could - egg rolls, beef rendang, fried tofu, prawn - it was all delicious.  It was a bit pricy, but that is not surprising given the neighborhood."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,"Worth a try for people who enjoys good food especially tasty peranakan cuisine. If spicy food is your thing, you will enjoy the food here. Service was good."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,-1,"just a normal Chinese restaurantwe've been there with a large group of 20+ guests and had chosen several different dishes (appetizer & main dishes) to share amongst us. the food was ok, but nothing really special. some dishes, like the mackarel, were nobody's flavor, maybe simply because not really differentiating to a normal fast food Chinese restaurant.conclusion of the group, some liked it (4*), some meant it was normal (3*) and some were disappointed (2*)PS: only some of the servant were able to speak English, but at least the others understood the words Beer and Rice... ;-)"
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,"I really enjoyed this place. I cannot comment on how true it is to Peranakan cuisine but for my palate I enjoyed the two vegetarian options I tried. Probably my favorite dining experience during my Singapore visit--everything I tried tasted incredible, and the service was excellent, which was in retrospect even more of a plus given how poor it seemed to be everywhere else. I'd recommend this and would gladly return."
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,We just tried a few dishes here after wandering around chinatown.   We were pleased with the quality of the food and had good service.
Asian Fusion,The Blue Ginger,1,"There are these times that one has an inkling that a place is good - just judging by what it looks like. I had noticed this restaurant a few times from the Kamayan across the street and went to eat there today with a friend, and yes: this place is really good. The cuisine is described as peranankan (the mixure of chinese and malay that is typical for the singapore chinese), but I suspect this is a means to present a cuisine that is really a fusion of the different cultures of Southeast Asia. No matter: the result is excellent. I had chicken in an Indonesian sauce based on nuts I did not know but that were delicious - chocolate like (ayam buah keluak), and my companion had pork knuckles braised to perfection in another herb mix (babi hong). Both tasted delicious and I certainly go back for more. Even the rice on itself was perfumed in a way I didn't recognize. All in all, we had an excellent meal - the best I had in this area of Singapore. And the prices were - by European standards - certainly affordable. It is however safe to make reservations: we were lucky to be early."
Chinese,The Clifford Pier,1,"I brought a friend to Clifford Pier for their Sunday brunch buffet. It was SGD52 per person and offered a wide variety of local foods. It was a great way for my friend to taste a mix of all the local foods in a beautiful historical setting. There was Chicken Rice, Satay, Kway Teow, dim sum, congee, sushi, rojak, laksa, chilli crab and other delicacies. Each dish is clearly labeled (especially with ingredients so if you have any food allergies you can avoid them). They also served local desserts and ice cream. Of course you could find better quality food at specific hawker locations or restaurants, but if you dont have time to hit various locations, this was a central location allowing my friend to have small samples and go in for repeats. The buffet also doesnt have a time limit, so we were there from 11:30am till 2:30pm (when they close). I am not sure how the a la carte menu is priced, but I would go for their buffet selection based on price and quality. Worth the visit and surely a place I will bring future guests who are on a short stop and never had any of the local flavors!"
Chinese,The Clifford Pier,-1,"5* Hotel but not the food. (The Peranakan Special Edition)I have wanted to dine at Clifford Pier for ages. It's a gorgeous restaurant in a gorgeous hotel, with an even more gorgeous view, so when The Clifford Pier promoted that they were having a Peranakan Cuisine showcase by guest Chef Philip Chia, I knew we had to give it a try. The menu isn't extensive, just the highlights of Peranakan Food like Ayam Buah Keluak, Babi Pongteh and Nonya Chap Chye but with all the essentials there, it was enough for us to give it a shot. Ayam Buah Keluak ($28) The benchmark of any Peranakan Reataurant has to be the Ayam Buah Keluak. You can usually determine how good or bad your dinner is going to be from the way this dish was prepared and it was no different here. The sauce was very fragrant and very good. Lighter and slightly more watery than those I'm used to, it still had distinctive taste from the Rempah (spice blend) with a hint of the Buah Keluak. The Buah Keluak itself was something special. We're used to having it either as it is, or with the ""meat"" dug out , mixed with minced pork and stuffed back in but this one was special. They dug it out, mixed with with the rempah before stuffing it back in the shell. This made the Buah Keluak meat very flavorful and less pungent, which is good for beginners. Only thing is the way they cracked the shell. We usually open it down the side but because the opened it at the top and made it a pretty small opening (smaller than the teaspoon give), it made it very difficult to dig out the filling with a knife. The let down though was the chicken. They gave three chunky pieces of thigh yet every piece was cooked till it was dry and tough. Very very disappointing. Babi Pongteh ($28)Another easily recognizable Peranakan dish, the Babi Pongteh is a wonderful stewed pork dish with a bean paste. The flavours again was very nice. The sauce was fragrant and wonderfully thickened by the fat from the pork belly. It is a bit sweeter that the Pongtehs that I'm used too but it wasn't by any means overpowering. The problem again was the cook of the meat. While the fat was wonderfully melt in your mouth and the meat around the fat was tender and juice, it got extremely dry and tough as you reached the bottom. Another case of overcooked protein. Nonya Chap Chye ($18)Probably Peranakans most well-know vegetable dish, a Nonya chap Chye is more than just putting vegetable together and boiling it in a pot. There's a lot of care that goes into it with each vegetables different cook time. The key to any Chap Chye is ensuring the sweetness of the cabbage shine yet allowing strong flavors of the fermented soya bean and dried Beancurd skin to come come through. Too much or little of either and it'll lose the balance of the dish. The version served here is easier on the palette for those who do not like the taste of beancurd skin or fermented bean paste. It's naturally sweet   With that hint of saltiness from the bean paste, however, I hate to eat it again and again but.......... It was overcooked!The cabbage was mushy, the carrots were so soft I could mash it with my tongue and even the black fungus, that normally offers a nice crunch to the otherwise soft texture, was cooked till I could break it apart without biting. Lemon Barely ($5)This had to be the most natural tasting lemon barleys I've ever had. No artificial, cordial lemon barely here. It was straight up boiled barley drink (yes with the cooked barley in the glass), rock melon and lemon juice. A good way to counter the richness and spiciness of the Peranakan dishes. On a whole, the dining experience was decent but certainly not 5 star quality. The ongoing trend here was that, while the flavors were good, the main protein and veg were all over cooked. Chicken, pork, vege, all cooked way over than it should be. I understand the need to leave them in the flavor the dish but there's a ceiling and unfortunately, all the dishes here went way way way over it. Oh and unfortunately, service wasn't up to standard too. 1) servers were not strategically placed. It took a while to get someone's attention as all the wait staff were near the entrance while we were near the rear. 2) they were preparing for an event outside. I know there's a need to have background music but a. Did they really need to blast the music and fill hall with bass-y chill out longer music? Considering that the guest hadn't even arrive? b. To rectify the issue, they ended up turning up the ambient music in the restaurant! Not till it was deafening because we could still talk but to a point that it was above the comfort range. So overall: Venue: 5*Ambience: 3* (thanks to he music) Service: 3* Food: 3* I would love to give this experience a 4 but I'll wait till my next visit before determining."
Chinese,The Clifford Pier,1,"We went here on our transit stop in Singapore and enjoyed a lovely buffet full of delicious yumminess, before our flight to Frankfurt. The hotel has a giant dining area, as well as a lounging area right beside it. Both are equally large with very high ceilings and an exquisite atmosphere. From what I have heard, the full-on buffet is not a regular happening, but on this day, there was a celebration in town (we went at the end of May), which was the partial reason for the buffet. From antipasti, to seafood, to salads, skewers, traditional rice- and noodle dishes, glazed pork belly and more; they had EVERYTHING on the menu. We were very happy with our choices.The staff was equally helpful with allergy questions and very attentive, which is also a great bonus. Can only recommend."
Chinese,The Clifford Pier,-1,"There are two restaurants within Fullerton Bay Hotel, so make sure you go to the correct one. The other one is called Clifford Restaurant so look out!This place is a beautiful dining hall overlooking the MBS side, with nice chandeliers, big big vases of white orchids, and soft background music playing by a live band (for dinner). It is a very, very pleasant experience to dine here. Service here is impeccable, and waitstaff are attentive and prompt.Let's come to the important bit. The food.Cuisine here is Singaporean hawker food, served with an upmarket touch. The prices here are a steep mark-up from the usual hawker fare, so be prepared to shell out some heavy dough. I came here with a companion and we started with two popiah rolls (thin crepes stuffed with turnip, prawns, egg) ($12). I had the laksa with lobster ($36), which I enjoyed, apart from it not having cockles... My grouse was that my laksa was not Instagram-worthy, with bits of chopped lobster scattered in the laksa. Come on guys, for 36 bucks++ the laksa better look good.My companion had fried snapper with brinjal/eggplant. He rated it 6/10. You have to order rice separately, which is $5 extra, but you have a choice between white and brown rice, which is freeflow. Pretty sweet. I like the brown rice option. Plus point for having healthier choices!We ended the meal with a key lime pie for him, and an ice kacang for me.The key lime pie was good, and had a good digestive crust. They were very accommodating when I mentioned I didn't want peanuts and red beans inside my ice kacang. The ice kacang differs from the hawker one - the ice is very finely blended/ground, so that it is soft and is melt-in-the-mouth, unlike the crunchy feel from the hawker ice kacang. Our bill for two came up to 200 because we had two beers and a glass of champagne (they sell Perrier Jouet by the glass ehre ($30)). If you don't drink, I think this meal is still affordable - comparable to a normal restaurant meal.Would I come back? Maybe. Definitely not getting alcohol next time!"
Chinese,The Clifford Pier,-1,"Ambience - classy and cosyFood - can be betterService - goodThe restaurant is overlooking Marina Bay Sands and is situated right on the spot of the old Clifford Pier where people board the boats to go to nearby islands. Although the place has been given a new wardrobe, the stuctures still remain and feels very nostalgic!"
Chinese,The Clifford Pier,-1,"You come here for the big hotel lobby ambience and the view of the Marina Bay Sands and all that. Food - not so much.We came for Sunday brunch, which featured mostly Sing/Malay stuff. They also have dim sum of sorts including some steamed stuff that is wheeled around in carts. It was all tasty enough, but really nothing special at all. And at S$48 per adult, it's expensive fare for what it is."
Chinese,The Clifford Pier,-1,"This is an upscale ""coffee Shop"" in Fullerton Bay Hotel. Food is an eclectic mixof local and western. Dishes are generously portioned but average. Flavors are somewhat authentic but skewed to western tastes. We had the key lime pie and rum baba for dessert. Avoid like the plague. It was terrible. It is somewhat better than your average coffee shop in ambiance and service. But with 3 star prices, it's a place to chill out for brunch or lunch in the weekend but ultimately not a value."
Chinese,The Clifford Pier,-1,"Only the fruit is tasty, all the food are terrible. Save your $ for something better."
Chinese,The Clifford Pier,1,"Had a colleague in town, and this was a nice respite after walking all the way along the Singapore River from Clarke quay MRT station. Definitely a nice place to bring visitors from out of town, as the place looks impressive, and you can show them google photos of that the Pier / area used to look like. Service is ok. Quality of food not too bad, but definitely on the pricey side. 12 sticks of satay for more than $20, and the meat on the skewers were strangely flat. The kong bak paus were pretty nice."
Chinese,Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,1,Was there on 14 March 2015..think they are either moving or or about to renovate.. No one answered the call.Closed. Several outlets still around. Thank Godness!
Chinese,Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,1,"Had the half chicken with a personal order of the yummy rice. It tasted good to me, I wouldn't wait in a long line for it but still very good. The Maxwell location was closed so we opted for this location. I prefer this location because it has a/c. That's something nice to have on the hot Singapore days. The chicken is tasty and the rice is pretty impressive. I recommend this to anybody going to Singapore"
Chinese,Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,1,"Hooray for having an outlet of the famous Tian Tian near my place!In a way, this is an upgrade from the original stall in Maxwell, as it's an actual restaurant space that's air conditioned. They also have a menu that looks pretty substantial; lots to look through with more offerings. I wouldn't be surprised if the other offerings are good, but I still prefer sticking to my favourite chicken rice at $3.80.The basic $3.80 order comes with chicken rice and some soup. It's been a while since I've been to the stall, but I'm unsure if they offer ginger or not as there was none offered on the table. The dark sauce and chilli sauce were in abundance, though!I usually come here during off peak times, but when I've usually passed by, I don't notice any long, snaking queues like in CBD. If you need your fix and you're in the east, you're in luck!"
Chinese,Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,1,"Described as one of Singapore's staple food, we had to try hainan chicken rice on our visit. Glad we got to try this - small place, super quick service and a cheap eat. The chicken is indeed very tender and juicy."
Chinese,Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,1,"This is not the famous branch of Tian Tian but the same delicious Hainanese Chicken Rice is offered here. Compared to my other favorite in Singapore, Boon Tong Kee, I personally think they're on par and that any preference in the differences are really dependent on your own taste buds.The rice here is more flavorful but also a tad more oily and salty. So if you're health-conscious in any way, this may not be a good option for you. The chicken is great, served at the appropriate temperature, and a good amount.This location is air-conditioned so you can eat in the cool comfort and a relatively good size. I'm really glad that a friend took me to try their food. I was extremely pleased with what I consumed that evening and I would recommend it to anyone visiting."
Chinese,Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,-1,"The Maxwell Food Centre location was closed when I went there to try the infamous  Hainanese chicken, but I came across this location by accident while exploring the neighborhood my hotel was located in. I was happy to see that I would not have to wait in line here!! The chicken itself is juicy and served chilled, which I had read is done so on purpose. The rice is very flavorful and compliments the chicken. The soup was the biggest disappointment of the meal. Overall, my own opinion is there is better Hainanese chicken to be had elsewhere. Evertop was my favorite place for this dish on my visit."
Chinese,Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,-1,"1. Half white, roasted chicken ($14)- preferred the roasted chicken to the white one which was a bit too fatter/oily tasting. - so much chicken!!! if this was half, i wouldn't dare see what is 1 full chicken 2. Hainanese Chicken Chop ($7) - Crispy! - the sweet sauce on it complimented it well too. - only complain was the sauce made the initially crispy chicken chops soggy after awhile. probably should have asked for the sauce to be served separately. 3. Sambal kangkong- bad. the veg doesn't taste fresh :( This store is supposedly very ""famous"" but I don't see what all the hyper is about. its chicken rice pretty ordinary. Would return for item 2 though."
Chinese,Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,1,"Unlike the other outlets, here's a place not just offering chicken rice but there's a kitchenette offering some hainanese dishes. I tried the hainanese chap chye, which is great alternative to the usual oyster sauce vegetables. It was a more flavourful option to the usual teochew chap chye that I would have and it is not as salty as the oyster sauce vegetables. I particularly enjoy the beansprouts with cuttlefish, which is a classic offering at all outlets. There is a good crunch and fresh breansprouts unlike some stalls with thin miserable sprouts swimming in an oily gravy. I like the interiors at this outlet, the white walls are inviting and the big tables make it ideal for group lunches and dinners and there is free on-site parking for patrons! You can also call to reserve or order a pick up if you are in a rush, service is rather friendly and swift too!"
Chinese,Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,1,"A favourite place for me to bring my tourist friends because they get to try the famous chicken rice (which I reckon is done really well here), along with other dishes that you won't be able to get if you had chicken rice at a hawker centre / food court, and in the comfort of air-conditioning. We always get half a roast chicken and half steamed - portions are generous you won't be disappointed! Some of the other dishes that I really like are the sweet potato leaves, beansprouts with salted fish and sweet and sour fish. There's also free parking for customers right outside the store - but parking is very limited so come early on a weekday, otherwise be prepared to park elsewhere and walk - parking is quite a hassle in congested Joo Chiat unfortunately."
Chinese,Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,-1,"The famous chicken rice stall in Maxwell Tian Tian, has a walk in restaurant on Joo Chiat Rd. Same fantastic cold cut steamed white chicken, fragrant rice and well balanced chili as its famous Maxwell counterpart. Though add a minimalistic restaurant fit out, with comfy chairs, good aircon and decent service and it now provides a more rounded experience than lining up in a dirty, crowded and hot hawker center. Mind you, it doesn't mean that there isn't the occasional queue at the door waiting for a table. They have a few side dishes and things like pork belly and porridge available, though who really walks into a place like this looking for more than chicken rice. The service here is surprisingly of a good standard for similar places and concepts. A must visit whenever I'm in the Joo Chiat Rd vicinity. Do take not though they are closed on Mondays."
Chinese,Tiong Bahru Hainanese Boneless Chicken Rice,1,I ordered char siew rice. It was probably the BEST char siew I've ever had. It came with a pretty big chops too and it was only $3.50++ any place with unlimited garlic-garlic sauce/dipping always has an extra value to me
Chinese,Tiong Bahru Hainanese Boneless Chicken Rice,-1,"A very average plate of chicken rice. I think most people associate Tiong Bahru with old school traditional good local food, or at least I did. I just wanted a simple quick lunch and it was fairly empty at 2ish pm. I ordered the chicken rice set which included a small plate of veggies. The only highlight would be the vegetables which were fresh and sweet and crunchy. At least they were not limp and overcooked. The rice was so-so, lacking the fragrance of chicken rice. The roasted chicken was not too bad, tender and deboned, making it easy to eat. Plus there was no layer of fats under the skin. The chili sauce which was the critical component of a good chicken rice was a bit mild. It did not have the oommph to take it to the next level, likewise for the ginger. Besides chicken rice (white and roasted), it also served curry rice. I think most diners were having chicken rice when I was there. Maybe that would be the better choice. I would eat here only if there were no other options."
Chinese,Tiong Bahru Hainanese Boneless Chicken Rice,-1,"So bad so bad.I tried the lunch set C which has pork chop, a side of cabbage, plus a whole fried fish. Sounds like great value at $5.50..but what's the point when it is so bad. I never had a thinner pork fillet. The pork chop has more flour than pork. It might as well be just fried flour. The fried fish is a whole fish...it''s ok I guess.Most people were eating the chicken rice. Maybe I should have just went for the norm instead of being adventurous. But it's going to take a while before I head back."
Chinese,Tiong Bahru Hainanese Boneless Chicken Rice,-1,"It's an okay chicken rice. Not great, not good, but not bad. Still a touch better than food court chicken rice. The steamed chicken is a little lean but still tasty with oily skin. It is also a bit bloodier than others. Not very bloody. But you notice it. The good thing about this place is the big menu. They also have lor ba, fried tofu, porridge, all kinds of sides and side dishes. It's conveniently located and feeds the office crowd in the area."
Chinese,Tiong Bahru Hainanese Boneless Chicken Rice,-1,"Ordered a steamed chicken set, with pork fillet and some vegetables. The vegetables is a little salty, the pork chop fillet only has tastes of the flour and salty stuff there is no meat tasted at all. The set menu isn't that value for money after all due to the little meat they give. I guess, working crowds at the central really doesn't have much of a choice for good food nowadays that they have to succumb to this."
Asian Fusion,True Blue Cuisine,1,"Unique Peranakan food!  True Blue is in a great old (100 year old) building.  It has an old Singapore feel.  Very friendly staff, great food, and a bit spicey.  Make sure to ask the staff when ordering.  They do a great job sterring you to the best dishes.  Worth coming back!Tip: ask the staff about the history and decorations and furnature.  They all are part of what old Singapore is about."
Asian Fusion,True Blue Cuisine,-1,Will not come back again. Over-priced for low standard peranakan food. Nice setting with some peranakan decorations. The Peranakan Museum next door is a must visit. Go somewhere else for real good peranakan food.
Asian Fusion,True Blue Cuisine,1,"Tried egg wrap, delicious, had a crunch and fish sauce flavor. Very interesting and tasty. Wish I tried more."
Asian Fusion,True Blue Cuisine,-1,"A beautiful restaurant transformed from a 100-year old mansion. The blue wall and old-time decor conjured up the fondest of fin de siècle.The food tasted quite strange and salty. It may be the reason that taste is acquired and my palate was not yet cultivated. The much recommended stewed chicken with black nuts looked dark and felt like Chinese medicine. The cured black nuts were not nutty and yet salty and bitter.Spicy banana blossom salad: refreshing and crispy. They used the flower of bananas to make the salad, and therefore blossom in the title.Crab and chicken meat soup: the meatball was not chewy and the meat was hard and starchy. Pass.Rendang beef: lack of the rendang flavor and the meat was a bit too lean.The only highlight the night was a cabbage stew with mushroom and black fungus. And of course, the fresh durian- I got a dollop of it as a side. One of my friends had to step out while I was eating the stinky fruit, because he could not stand the smell. Haha.. people are so different ;)"
Asian Fusion,True Blue Cuisine,1,"During our trip to Singapore last week, our friend who lives there recommended this restaurant if we wanted to try local (Peranakan) cuisine. My wife, her sister and husband and I went there for lunch. We loved the food and great service. We did not know much about Peranakan cuisine. So, we asked the restaurant staff to recommend what we should eat. Everything was fantastic!! The salad, soup, chicken with nuts (incredible), prawns, etc.If you are in Singapore, we highly recommend this restaurant. The exterior and interior are like a museum. Beautiful!! Don't rush it. Enjoy the food and atmosphere. Then go to the Peranakan Museum afterwards or before if you have time. You will get a better sense of the food's origin."
Asian Fusion,True Blue Cuisine,1,The best food i have ever had in Singapore. They charge you for everything but whatever. The service is diligent. Charming place with great atmosphere.
Asian Fusion,True Blue Cuisine,1,This is a very unique restaurant with multi blended ethnic foods coming together. the menu is not overwhelming so you can take your time enjoy several things. Poisonous nuts when cooked properly they're not poisonous.Great food scene in Singapore.
Asian Fusion,True Blue Cuisine,1,"First, I can not write this review without considering another review that I need to compose.  That is for Blue Ginger, another Peranakan restaurant I recently visited.I've eaten at True Blue twice.  While the same exact food was ordered each time, the experience was considerably different.I will start with the consistencies.  This is with the food and ambiance.  Each time, the exact same dishes were ordered.  Each time, the food was simply amazing.The spicy banana flower salad.  I find this dish to be very refreshing and the presentation is quite lovely.  There is a mixture of  sweet, savoury, and spicy that comes together just right.tinyurl.com/9efxpoeThe first time I ever tried Chicken with Buah Keluak (black nut) was at True Blue.  I fell in love with the dish.  The richness of the Buah Keluak is simply amazing.  I've been told it is an acquired taste.  If so, my acquisition skills must be very good.  Because, from my first bite, I just wanted more.  The chicken is cooked perfectly.  It is simply a little pot of goodness.  If I had a complaint it would be that there could be more of it.tinyurl.com/8ehbqj6tinyurl.com/9ms74heThen there is the Tiger Prawns with curry leaves.  What can I say?  They are huge.  They are sweet and delicate.  They are as close to being lobster tail as you can get without being from a lobster.tinyurl.com/9scmpraI think the food at True Blue is very good.The other consistency is the room itself.  It is a beautiful room.  It has charm.  It feels as if you are in someone's home.  The very high ceilings give the room a feeling of space.  You feel like you have stepped back in time.Now, I must note the key inconsistency.The first time, I went with a regular who was introducing me to the restaurant.  The meal was well-paced and relaxed.  Dishes came and dishes went.  The staff was very attentive.  Overalll, it was a very pleasurable meal.The second time, I took a friend to introduce her to the restaurant.   We arrived and we were quickly seated.  Soon after we ordered.  In just a few moments, the food began to arrive.  When I say food, I mean all of it.  It was all brought out at the same time.  There was no pacing.  It was not really a dining experience as much as it was simply eating.  We were finished in 30 minutes.True Blue is not an inexpensive restaurant.  I do not mind paying well for great dining experiences.  But, dining isn't only about the food.  If it was, I would eat every meal at a hawker centre.  When I am paying for an expensive meal, I expect it to feel like a experience.   It is a shame. It was great food served in a great ambiance.  But, it felt like a fast food experience.If my second trip had matched my first one, I would be giving True Blue five stars.  My next trip will determine if they should retain their current four stars.The food is amazing.  The flavors are great.  The presentation is very good.  The room is beautiful.  There just needs to be more attention given to the overall experience."
Asian Fusion,True Blue Cuisine,-1,"Nice flavor Nonya Food, beautiful decor, very little portion but OVERLY charged! $3 Singapore dollars per person for the rice , I didn't even touch the rice , they charged us $12 because we have 4 people! $4 per person for tea, &28 for a small fried fish! A very small dish pomelo about 100g cover with one table spoon peanuts is $18!Prawn cracker $1 per person ,black nuts chicken $24 , we asked them to add 2 nuts they charged us $4 per two nuts, anyway total $228.34 without wine!You can have this kind of food at other  Pararakan Food for May be 1/2 price or even less .  If you want to try their god be ready for the high payment!"
Asian Fusion,True Blue Cuisine,1,"This is my all-time favorite Peranakan restaurant in Singapore.  From the moment you spot the storefront it's like a journey back in time.  The beautiful white orchids greet you as you pass through the small door into the entrance way.  There you start to immerse yourself in the gorgeous surrounding of a heritage Peranakan shophouse.  Last night we dined with a couple of friends of my cousin who are in town for business.  Luckily they are adventurous eaters.  They did have trouble finding it but seemed to enjoy the plush surrounds.  We sat in the corner with a full view of the restaurant and the china collection cabinet.  We ordered our favorites: the banana blossom & cucumber salad, sweet potato leaves, okra in candlenut sauce, black nut chicken, fried chicken in Indonesian spices, and beef rending.  The dishes came out of the kitchen at a steady pace.  Rice and tea were refilled plentifully.  I drank so much of the red date & longan tea that I had a mild sugar high mid meal. I cannot speak highly enough of the banana salad.  I have never been able to identify the banana blossom in the dish but the sauce is so good I don't really care what is in it.  I usually polish off the dish myself while people focus their attention elsewhere.  Like hollowing out their black nuts and chicken.  This is another stunning dish here.  The chicken is infused with more of the black nit flavor than other versions of this dish I have tasted.  The beef rending is simply superb.  I don't care for fried chicken but our guests fought over the last piece so it must have been delicious. plates clean the dessert came: pineapple tarts and some mango puree and pomelo for me. I hadn't gotten enough of pomelo from the juice which was amazing.  The pineapple tarts are homemade and you can tell.  Our guests commented that it didn't taste like pineapple at all. Either way, they ate them with delight.  We sat for a long time after the meal in deep conversation about the country.  The atmosphere in this restaurant makes you want to talk about important things.  After holding the table for over two hours we departed.  But it won't be long before I'm back for that salad."
Asian Fusion,True Blue Cuisine,-1,"5-star setting, pity about the foodTrue Blue is possibly the prettiest Nonya matriach in town. Gorgeous artwork such as the beaded slippers are displayed in one of the rooms, while another houses a breathtaking array of lace blouses. The ground floor seating area is the main hall, while a few private rooms upstairs and one on the ground floor are popular for wedding ceremonies and private events.Pity then that the food and service appear indifferent and lacking in soul. Ayam buah keluak was the best dish, while everything else really failed to exhibit depth of flavour. The beef rendang was tough and barely warm when it hit the table, the chap chye watery. Prawns petai style were not fresh and lacked in sambal. Oh and if you want extra sambal, you will have to pay for it. Not surprising then with the small sizes of the dishes that the bill quickly adds up. Desserts were overhyped; the ""best pineapple tart in Singapore"" was mediocre with its dried out jam centre not yielding any moistness.This is a really beautiful restaurant to bring overseas guests, but only the connoisseur will know that there are smaller, more boutique Peranakan restaurants serving far better quality dishes."
Asian Fusion,True Blue Cuisine,-1,"Condescending service with really bad service. Staff was rushing us to leave even though it was just 9.30pm and started turning off the lights. Extremely surprising experience given the price point and posh positioning of the restaurant. Food was fantastic though, although I value service above the quality of food. Verdict: Go for it only if you want to enjoy the food and be prepared for nasty service."
Asian Fusion,True Blue Cuisine,1,Excellent traditional peranakan cuisine in a beautiful traditional Chinese house setting.  The food is authentic and has all the right variety of selection (the service staffs were helpful and knowledgable about the dishes).  It takes you back to the golden time of an era with photos from the past!  Recommended esp for taking friends to have a peranakan experience!
Chinese,Wah Kee Big Prawn Noodles,1,"wah kee, the big prawn noodles nazi?be afraid, be really afraid, whispered the masses.and so afraid i was that only recently did i try them out.well, you see, fear is but a choice and once i chose not to fear, the reward is sweet!a sweet, rich, fresh prawns broth, full of garlicky goodness with a subtle hint of spiciness.wah kee, the big prawn noodles nazi?to me, uncle is a friendly father figure.a survival of two major operations, thanks in part to surgeon customers in our midst.aunty can be sweet too, IF you follow a few simple rules:1) do stay at least one metre away from the stall when queuing.2) do speak only when spoken to3) do not try to cut queue.4) do come back in good time or stay within visual range after you have placed your order as they will only make your order when they know you are ready to collect immediately.5) do not mess up her stall by spilling the chilli infused soy sauce or the precious prawn broth when collecting your order. 6) do not return the tray, as they pay good money for trays to be returned to them via cleaners.wah kee, the big prawn noodles nazi?well, they do hoard some of the biggest prawns for a hawker stall and i am thankful for that.if you can afford to spare a twenty, just go for the biggest bowl that they sell!it is big enough for sharing although you only get 3 BIG prawns.as for the carb selection, that is a personal preference.but i do like their dry mee kia, laden with crispy shallots and lardons.i have also discovered a sweet spot on saturday mornings just before 9am whereby i will encounter the shortest possible queue.so far, so good and hopefully it will stay as such even after this review goes out?wah kee, the big prawn noodles nazi?all hail, uncle and aunty!;)"
Chinese,Wah Kee Big Prawn Noodles,-1,"Now when it comes to Prawn Mee, the one thing I think we can all agree on, is that the tastes and preferences of our locals differs quite substantially. Everyone has an opinion on how the best prawn Mee should taste like.Believe me when I said that I've tried many ""famous"" places since the 80s till now. Shops have come and gone, newer ones or the better marketed (through social media or word of mouth) has made their way to the limelight and are sometimes over hyped. I'm caught in between opinions when it comes to this store and here's my experience -I was lucky enough to join the queue on a Saturday morning minutes before noon and only queued about 30mins for this ( I heard it can be up to an hour plus). The stall is runned by an elderly couple. The uncle prepares all the food in the background and the Aunty takes orders and collect the cash. I heard the Aunty can get a little grumpy but with all grumpy old folks I don't really take any offence and laugh it off as cute.""Aunty! 2 $10 bowl! 1Meepok 1kwaytiao! Dry ah! :)""""Don't have $10 already! Sold out! Got $15! Today the prawn very good! Fresh and big! Ah!""""Ok la Aunty! Gimme 2 $15 bowl then la :D""I then proceed to wait another 5-7mins before receiving 2 bowls of dried chilli noodles and another 2 mini woks of 3 giant prawns each. Verdict: Soup indeed tastes very healthy. You can distinctively taste the sweetness of the boiled prawn heads in the broth. However I'm used to having my soup a little bit more on the saltier side when it comes to prawn Mee. (I guess I grew up that way) their dry noodles are like your usual market type Mee pok with chilli or kway teow with chilli. Nothing special. The star of the show goes to the prawns! They were big! They were juicy! They were cruncy! Not the least bit dry and cooked to absolute perfection! If you are craving for damn good prawns without going to a seafood restaurant, this is THE PLACE!But with the long wait, and location... It's not something that tells me ""I MUST come back IMMEDIATELY"" after I've had my last scoop of soup.Maybe in a few months times perhaps.. But I still have a favourite prawn Mee stall that keeps me going, but this isn't it. 3.6 STARS"
Chinese,Wah Kee Big Prawn Noodles,1,"Pek Kio food centre is famous for many local hawker fare. The name 'Pek Kio' is actually Chinese dialect for 'white bridge', which was how the locals described Cambridge back in the days. Many of the stalls here have long histories and with that, long queues. One of the most famous is Wah Kee Prawn Noodles, famed for its LARGE prawns and LONG queues.Though I'm not a big fan for soupy prawn noodle, I can understand the fuss about this stall. The prawn soup is thick and fragrant, while the prawns are big and juicy. And when I say big, I mean BIG big. It is often rated as the best prawn noodle stall in Singapore and its hard to disagree. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the super long queues."
Chinese,Wah Kee Big Prawn Noodles,-1,"The prawn noodles used to be much better. The soup richer and more flavorful. And the old auntie used to bring your noodles to your table, with a pack of complimentary tissue.Now the lines are crazy long. The soup is still reddish from the prawn head roe...but the soup base tasted more watered down than the good old days.Note: if you prefer mee kia (thin noodles), you have to come early as they are usually out of that by noon. After which, I will go for my second choice of noodles-beehoon."
Chinese,Wah Kee Big Prawn Noodles,1,"When I crave for prawn mee, this is where I go for my fix. The soup stock is rich and flavorful, and the prawns are big. I always order the most expensive bowl, that has the biggest prawns--they serve the prawns and noodles in two separate bowls.I normally go there for an early or late lunch to avoid the long Q."
Asian Fusion,Waku Ghin,1,"KenScale: 9.5/10The best meal I had during my stay in Singapore also happened to be the most expensive one. I wouldn't say that a more expensive meal would necessarily be the best, but the one I had at Waku Ghin was just absolutely fantastic. I would definitely say it's one of my all-time best Japanese meals of my lifetime. Located inside the famed Marina Bay Sands hotel (where I stayed just so I could check out the fabulous infinity pool) and helmed by internationally acclaimed chef Tetsuya Wakuda, Waku Ghin has long been one of the pillars of the great gastronomic scene. At Waku Ghin, you will get seated at a counter where a chef comes out to serve 10-course degustation menu, priced at whopping S$400 per person (thank god the dollar to Singapore dollar exchange rate during my visit was as favorable as it could get!). The chef will bring a gigantic plate of all the raw seafood that will be a part of your meal. With that price tag, each dish really had to be worth every penny, which is a nearly impossible feat, yet Waku Ghin pulled this out beautifully. There were some really taste bites of seafood, from Japanese sawara (mackerel) that worked beautifully with eggplant and seaweed vinaigrette to slow-cooked New Zealand John Dory with grilled eggplant to roasted New Zealand scampi. One of the signature dishes at the restaurant, the marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served inside the sea urchin shell was pure nirvana, and I could seriously eat this dish any given day. The best dish in my mind, however, was the impeccable Tasmanian abalone that came with fregola pasta and tomato. It showed that the restaurant could also draw a page from Western influence, and I still can't forget the beautifully cooked abalone that worked wonders with the pasta. I was also deeply impressed with the braised Canadian lobster that came with aromatic tarragon jus. Lobster was as perfectly cooked as it ever gets, and the tarragon jus worked its magic to further add another dimension to the dish. An assortment of fabulous seafood was followed by some meat dishes. Deboned spatchcock (chicken) was well-cooked and worked harmoniously with black truffle. My only compliant with wagyu roll was that there was too little of it, but otherwise the meat's texture was absolutely juicy and tender. Following a serving of soothing somen and gyokuro (green tea), I was led to the main dining area where desserts started coming in. Tasmanian leatherwood honey ice cream with granite of lemon and gin jelly, a light and refreshing dish, was followed by Ghin cheesecake (""Ghin"" stands for silver in Japanese), another winning dessert that I wished I could have more of. The restaurant has a classy and formal vibe but I still saw families with casual apparel enjoying their casual time together. The services of the professionally dressed staffs were attentive, and you can complement your meal with a variety of drinks from wine to sake to cocktails. Waku Ghin will blow your mind if you're looking for a serious Japanese fare with Western touches. I've always been impressed with the craftsmanship, dedication and discipline that Japanese chefs display, and while the glitzy atmosphere of Marina Bay Sands may make you think the meal at Waku Ghin is overpriced and overrated, it is anything but. Okay, maybe the price may force you to eat cheap food for the next month or so, but if you're looking for a once-in-a-lifetime meal, Waku Ghin is pretty damn close!"
Asian Fusion,Waku Ghin,1,"Amazing food, great service and superb wine pairing. My favorite was the cold noodle at the end of the meal. It was surprising refreshing."
Asian Fusion,Waku Ghin,1,There is a reason why this place is ranked as one of the Top 50 restaurants in the world. A culinary experience not to be missed!
Asian Fusion,Waku Ghin,-1,"Never thought I would say this, but I found a downside to spontaneity. And that is: can't get reservations anywhere!So I figured I'll just eat at the bar. It's a la carte at the bar. There's both counter and tables at the bar. Ordered the steak. It was okay. The sauce was too sweet, which really did not help bring out the flavor of the steak. Normally I love sweet sauce on anything, so I don't know what they did wrong with this sauce. Just didn't go.Perhaps, the food is better not at the bar, but after this steak, I'm not dying to come back."
Asian Fusion,Waku Ghin,1,"My life is complete...I ate off of the bar menu at Waku Ghin because the actual meal was definitely out of my price range. Even though the bill still came out to about $300 USD for 2 people, this is likely one of the best food-related choices I have ever made in my life. From the drinks to the food, everything was top-notch. Just as I thought I had reached ecstasy, the next bite always proved me wrong.We ordered 3 dishes: Lobster open face sandwich, sea urchin set on vinegared rice with caviar, Spaghettini with Alaskan King Crab & Tomato. I've sat around for 30 minutes thinking about how to describe these dishes, but I simply can't find the words to justify how good they were. The Spaghettini is the most ordinary and replicable dish here. The Lobster sandwich and uni/caviar were out of this world, and completely indescribable.We also had 2-3 drinks each. I ordered various sake cocktails, all of which required an amazing level of creativity to create. I have never seen or had sake cocktails in America, so this was refreshing and intriguing for me. My girlfriend ordered 3 fresh fruit cocktails. Each of them were blended into a smoothie, but were also unique in its own way. The passion fruit cocktail was blended with real passion fruit so the freshness of the fruit and the seed were all infused into the drink. The grapefruit cocktail had separate and distinct pulps that exploded in your mouth as you drink and popped them. The bartenders here really outdid themselves.I apologize for my inability to do justice in describing the food. However, I can confidently say that this was the best meal I have ever had - - which is incredible because the food was ordered off of its bar menu."
Asian Fusion,Waku Ghin,1,"Waku Ghin is a great restaurant with a plethora of flavors to keep your taste buds busy. It will also make you feel as inflated as a blimp afterwards since it's just so much food. Also, be sure to set aside 3.5 to 4 hours to dine here, it's long. Took off a star because I was only wow'd by one of the courses and drinks are below mediocre. Most of the dishes are good, but not memorable. I've been here on two separate occasions. Once I came alone after a friend was stuck at work and the second time with my girlfriend on one of our first dates. You walk into the casino area of MBS and are pleasantly welcomed by the staff as they open the doors for you and and seat you to your room where you will sit alongside 2-3 other couples (was a bit awkward when I came solo).Your chef comes into the room and introduces himself along with what he calls the ""menu"", or simply a showcase of the fish that will be prepared for the meal. You say OK and move on with your culinary journey.Both of my experiences, I had essentially the same dishes (I believe it was the same season in two different years since the menu changes by season). I had the following (out of order unfortunately)1) Shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served in a sea urchin shell (their signature dish) - Excellent as one would expect2) Ocean trout with witlof and yuzu - Ok3) Beef with arugula - Simple but meat was cooked nicely4) Lobster in a garlic type sauce - This was very nicely done5) King crab leg cooked and covered over a bed of salt and bamboo leaf - This is the one dish that stood out for me. Easily my favorite and one I could rave about. 6) Live steamed abalone served with fregola - Pretty much your typical abalone dish but with a slight twist.7) Japanese Waygu beef slice with garlic chips and fresh wasabi - Nice8) Consomme with rice and snapper - Good9) Somen with myoga and junsai - Nice refreshing dish10) Honey ice cream with gin and lemon jelly - Sweet yet easy to eat11) Cheesecake - Unfortunately was just a cheesecake.My girlfriend and I both had cocktails which to me were both pretty bad. We even went to the bar after and had drinks there and they were mediocre at best. For a bar that advertises itself throughout the hotel, they really aren't that good. Wish we stuck with sake.After these experiences, I really wasn't that wow'd. Most of the flavors are those you can find if you have any of these fish at other restaurants, except the king crab leg which blew my mind. The setting and setup are all very cool but I definitely left hoping for much more that I didn't get and I can only imagine that these guys will get better. Most of the dishes again are good but not great and memorable.If Michelin came to Singapore, these guys would for sure be in the mix for a potential 3 stars since they fit the criteria but they need to build more dishes with truly unique and memorable flavors. Otherwise, I think it's worth a shot to try it out for the experience."
Asian Fusion,Waku Ghin,-1,"I guess our expectations were different and we didn't have the required refined tastes to enjoy the meal. We were a party of 6, had the omakase ofc, some v expensive sake, and 6xS$20 of still water?!?Overall i was dissapointed. Maybe I did not enjoy the subtleness of the 10 well-presented courses enough but honestly I was expecting to be wowed but in the end I came away with 3000 reasons why I could have eaten elsewhere for 5* food but much much better value.The uni was decent and the a5 wagyu was ok but everything else was sub-par and honestly not worth the $400++ ?don't forget gst + service) we paid per person. However our chef from Japan was a highlight in an otherwise mediocreally-supposed ta be-haute-gastronomic experience.Like the new hublot ferrari engine watch. Or not.O well. At least they had phone charger for my poor Android phone..*also was expecting like otoro or some other sashimi :(( but o well i guess u can't choose in omakase."
Asian Fusion,Waku Ghin,1,"dear wakuda san,i hope this letter finds you well.my father won big by taking germany to win the world cup and so was able to dine in your restaurant last night.coincidentally, it was his birthday but alas he dined WITHOUT ME, as he said you were too expensive for kids to tag along:(the first thing he said, when i saw him this morning was,""son, you need to study really hard and make sure that you can speak clearly and communicate properly!""i was perplexed.but apparently, the uncles and aunties who served him last night weren't able to do so without him constantly having to ask them to repeat what they said, again and again.despite that, service was still good but communications was a big F.i guess your exquisite culinary creations have to speak for themselves?!the awkward teppanyaki counter setup further detracted from the dining experience as it proved more of an obstacle to service rather than a chance to showcase your gourmet menu.frankly speaking, there were no knives flying nor fancy schmancy cooking skills that warrants the teppanyaki counter's existence.anything he had, from the teppan, could easily have been cooked in the kitchen.the only good thing about it was he got to snap more shots for posting on Yelp!he also mentioned another uncle customer commented on how you no longer cook your abalone dish at the counter anymore.so it's just the canadian lobster, tasmanian cape grim beef and japanese ohmi wagyu beef that benefited from the under utilized, obtrusive teppan.you are probably better off without it!BUT obviously, he LOVED your food!5 stars for that alone!he flew to sydney just to dine at your flagship restaurant and has been ever so effusive about your delicate cooking that incorporates the best produce and is always full of flavours!just check out his gazillion photos(when he gets round to uploading them all) and you can't help but click on 'LIKE'!he said that it looks as good as it tastes or is it the other way around?!anyway, just when he thought dinner was over, you moved him into a much cosier environment for his just desserts!the pre-dessert kyoho grapes and granita was simple but amazing, so sweet yet with a tinge of sour and the icy granita kept those seedless halves just firm enough before melting away in your mouth!the dessert proper was a mango passion fruit cremet d'anjou, not properly explained and he had to refer to the menu they printed out for him, it was quality but nothing mind blowing.then he was surprised with what looks like your signature chocolate cake with perfectly scribbled chocolate birthday wishes! thank you for saving me the trouble of having to buy him a birthday cake!i mean the cake i buy, can never come close to the velvety finish that he mentioned in passing.finally, your petit cinq completed a lovely evening of gastronomy.even though he was so full, he still popped every single one into his mouth instead of bringing some home for me!:(uncle, you kept him away for a good 3 hours but that was a good thing as it allowed the bottle of tsuki no katsura iwaimai, nigori, junmai daiginjo to vanish and for him to depart on a sake high.thank you for making it an overall memorable evening for him.yours sincerely,nik juniorp.s. hopefully, he does not have to wait till the next world cup to be back again!;)"
Asian Fusion,Waku Ghin,1,"Located in the glitzy expanse of Marina Bay Sands, Waku Ghin definitely offers culinary decadence. The experience is without a doubt very expensive but the 10 course degustation meal was hands down among my favorite of all time. I am certain that I can't describe the plates any better than the previous reviews have. However, I can confidently say that the food tastes as good as the descriptions and pictures project.What stood out to me most though was the precision and attentiveness of the service. If you want to be left alone to eat a meal in the corner, this is not your place. The staff here are incredibly well trained and go impressively above and beyond to be accommodating to their guests."
Asian Fusion,Waku Ghin,1,"Waku Ghin. Constantly one of frontrunners for 'Best Restaurant in Singapore', a meal there will set you back a cool $400++ per head, not counting water or wine. Even then, I'm going to say it's worth going at least once. Each course is a myriad of flavours and textures, all meant to bring out the natural flavours of the ingredients in as dazzling a way as possible. The signature dish of marinated botan ebi, sea urchin, and oscietra caviar, is salty yet sweet, clean tasting yet rich. And amazingly, it wasn't even my favourite dish. Personally I felt that it was just a little too ostentatious, a little too opulent. The charcoal grilled beef served with mustard was real delight, the beef was full-flavoured and the smoky flavour of the grill lingered in the most teasing of ways. Every time a dish came in a broth, we ended up drinking from the bowl, because apparently spoons weren't always part of the dining experience... but the amount of time and quality of ingredients that went into each of those nourishing liquids must have been significant, because they were all packed with flavour.Dessert... was a little lacklustre. After the brilliance of the courses before it, the simple coconut mousse with mango was almost insipid by comparison, and a rather disappointing portion size at that. One thing I must highlight however, is that the service really impressed. It wasn't as subtle or unobtrusive as I've experienced at other top-class restaurants, but they did manage one thing that sets them apart from any other dining experience I've had in Singapore. They noticed I was left-handed, and proceeded to place all the cutlery as a left-hander would use it (opposite of the normal place settings). I've never had that ever happen in Singapore (overseas yes), and that alone redeemed the seamless but average service we received for the rest of the evening."
Asian Fusion,Waku Ghin,1,Amazing food.  Watching the preparation was great too.  Overall a fantastic experience!
Asian Fusion,Waku Ghin,1,"In the world of celebrity chefs, Tetsuya Wakuda is up there with the best in the world.  Many of us have had the privilege of dining at his Sydney restaurant, Tetsuya's, but how many of us have had the opportunity to dine at his Singapore restaurant, Waku Ghin?  Well, now, I can add myself to those lucky people. Waku Ghin, translates to 'arise silver' and pays homage to Tetsuya's routes, offering a 10 course Japanese inspired degustation menu.  The restaurant is located in the iconic Marina Bay Sands complex, and offers a unique dining experience.  In fact, Waku Ghin was just voted in the 2012 S. Pellegrino Top 50 restaurants of the world.  Now, that's an achievement! The experience of Waku Ghin starts the moment you walk through the doors and are greeted by the attentive staff.  To the left is an impressive sake bar and caviar lounge, perfect for pre-dinner drinks. Continue through the restaurant, and you are greeted by a curved timber walled hallway, with private Teppanyaki rooms situated off to each side.  Understated elegance is the theme and though it is impressive to say the least, there is nothing ostentatious about the space.  Warm timber compliments features of slick silver, with ornate vases and ornaments cleverly lit to create the perfect ambiance , alongside glimpses of the Singapore skyline. The restaurant seats only 25 people at a time, offering 2 sittings each evening.  Guests are seated in private Teppanyaki rooms.  This evening, Mr J and I have our own personal Teppanyaki chef, dedicated to creating our 10 course degustation menu.  We share our Teppanyaki room with another couple, who also have their own personal chef. The 10 course degustation menu is tailored to your individual taste on the evening, and our chef takes the time to discuss our menu with us.  I should also note, you will not be disappointed with the extensive wine list.  If you can't find something to tickle your fancy, then you're not looking hard enough. With our wine and food sorted, we proceed to sit back, relax and soak up the amazing experience of dining at Waku Ghin. Our menu:* 'Like Oyster' - Scallop with Daikon and Oyster Leaf* Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar* Grilled Tailfish with Japanese Matsutake* Pan-Seared Foie Gras with Kyoho* Australian Abalone with Fregola and Tomato* Braised Canadian Lobster with Tarragon* Charcoal Grilled Australian Lamb with Couscous* Japanese Ohmi Wagyu Roll from Shiga Prefecture with Wasabi and Citrus Soy* Scampi Pasta* Gyokuro Our dining experience commences with our chef showing us the seafood we are about to eat.  I can't help but notice the poor little lobsters are still alive!  At least we know it's fresh! Our chef then proceeds to expertly prepare for us each dish, one at a time, carefully explaining the dish as he goes along.  I love the personal interaction with the chef, and revel in the opportunity to watch the expert preparation up close and personal. Each dish is perfectly presented and looks as much a piece of art, as a plate of food.  Each mouthful is accompanied by the raising of my eyebrows and an animated 'wow' coming out of my mouth!  Time and time again, every one of those 10 courses achieves the same reaction.   Once our degustation is complete, we are escorted to a separate room to retire for our dessert.  The room offers spectacular views of the Singapore skyline. Our dessert menu:* Cold Soup of Dates with Tonka Bean Ice Cream and Orange* Pistachio Ice Cream with Raspberry and Chantilly* Coffee or Tea and Petit Fours The desserts do not disappoint and cap off a perfectly enchanting evening.  We are each presented with a personal menu, dated and detailing our food and wine choices for the evening.  A lovely touch and memento. Though pricey, dining at Waku Ghin is an amazing experience.  From the food, to the decor, to the service.  This is seamless top class dining.  This is an experience I am going to remember for a long time to come."
Asian Fusion,Waku Ghin,1,"A place for high-rollersAt $400 per head before taxes, Waku Ghin is a big commitment even before you start your dinner. (And yes, they take your credit card upon reservation - if you don't show up, they deduct the price anyway). The set-up of the 25-seater restaurant is sparse and muted. The main element is silver (ghin), which apparently is chef's favourite. Diners perch on uncomfortable bar stools for most of the 2-hour+ /10-course meal before moving to the lounge to be served a sliver of dessert. Service is not up to par as expected - having told the receptionist that I was dining there on occasion of my birthday, we were greeted with complete indifference, not even an acknowledgement of the big day. No matter. The non-existent service throughout the meal at least meant we weren't bothered by inept staff. The food is top notch, comprising ingredients that are at the very top of their category and treated minimally at the teppan counter. The private chef - one to every 2 diners - does a show and tell for his dishes before preparing it, whether searing a piece of wagyu or cooking the abalone to the perfect texture. Some dishes are prepared in the kitchen, such as the signature of botan shrimp and creamy Hokkaido sea urchin. The customised teppan plate is truly the star - having your food cooked before your eyes does much to whet the appetite.  For normal folks, Waku Ghin is a one-time splurge, but high rollers apparently dine there weekly - so I guess the standard of the food will always be high. Just know what to expect (it's not haute gastronomy the likes of Restaurant Andre or Jaan) and you'll probably enjoy your $400 worth of prime ingredients, done well."
Asian Fusion,Waku Ghin,1,"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Singapore. the ambiance and the food, defines what good dining experience should be. It is expensive and reservations are hard to come by, but its worth it."
Asian Fusion,Waku Ghin,1,... We love Japanese Food ... And we love Waku Ghin ..t ambiance is frendly but can be formal n stiff .. Depends on t company ypu are with. Food is always good .. T few times ?'? bin der .. It has been most satisfactory ... Love it
Chinese,Whitley Rd Big Prawn Noodle,1,"The flavors and seasonings are on point. I got my prawn noodles dry with soup on the side. The prawns were disappointing because they are not big like the name states. However, the flavors made up for it. The soup is delicious with a great sweet seafood taste. You can even see the red prawn juices floating on top. The original and simplest is the prawn mee, but you can also opt for pork rib, liver, etc. They come in 4 to 5 different sizes to please all palates. The line is long and it takes forever to get your order. Don't be fooled if the line looks short, because everyone who has already ordered is sitting around waiting for their noodles. After you order, you're given a laminated number in which the owner will shout out in Mandarin and English when your order is ready. It took 40 mins to get to the front of the line and about another 30 minutes to get my bowl of noodles. I didn't mind because I could munch on all the other delicious snacks in the nearby stalls. The seating is first come, first serve. You can reserve a seat by placing a packet of tissue on the table. I guess that's proper hawker etiquette. Don't be weirded out if others sit at your table too. It's all communal seating."
Chinese,Whitley Rd Big Prawn Noodle,1,"Pretty good value for $4. I came to Old Airport today with the intention of eating something else. It was closed. So I tried this. The soup is v flavourful. For 2 large prawns split into half, at this price, cannot complain"
Chinese,Whitley Rd Big Prawn Noodle,1,"Big Prawn Noodle with pork ribs. This noodle soup taste great, you will be able to smell the fresh prawn soup while standing in waiting for your noodle bowl. There are two stalls selling this concoction but the other stall version seems a tad too oily. You may also like that oily version as it also has a line there. For the price you get several half prawns plus four pieces pork rib. The amount of noodle is little for $5. The soup was the best part of the meal and worth the price. You can taste the freshness of the prawn and the pork oil taste does not over power the flavour.If only they gave more noodle, they may get ful marks."
Asian Fusion,Wild Rocket,1,"wow rocket, how you have grown!(??????come october you will be 10 years old and i think it's time i chipped in with this review.your transformation is now complete after getting a much deserved, gorgeous facelift last year.i really like how you have matured, like a good wine.from willin's days as a lawyer home chef for hire, to him taking that plunge to ditch the legal fraternity with only a passion for the chef apprentice's apron and then learning the way of the  kitchen on the job before striking out with a modern singaporean creativity as inspiration.his gregarious personality and boundless creativity made him a hit from the start, albeit not with me.don't get me wrong, his food was good but in his early days i felt it lacked that polished finish which always led me to think i can also do that leh.nonetheless, he became a cult figure almost instantly.i thought he was but a pricey fad but boy has history proven me wrong.i think willin and his team kept on learning, innovating and did not stay put in their comfort food zone.sure people still ask for that laksa pesto dish and i'm sure he will still whip one up for you, but his repertoire has grown many folds.there is also now a sophistication much like how your pony tailed girl will one day be adorned with foundation, blusher, mascara and lipstick.and of course, it's beyond just mere cosmetic changes.the blossoming comes from within, how she carries herself oozing with confidence, speaking with maturity and a dad-i'm-not-a-little-girl-anymore look!that is when you know, for sure, she has arrived.and all of that shows through his current omakase offerings.every dish left me eagerly anticipating the next and lifted, slowly but surely, the ratings to a solid five!willin has been a celebrity chef for years now.he does not need any affirmation, least so from me.but after a delectable dining experience here last night, i knew i had to finally put in my two cents worth.yes, i got out of bed at 4.45am just to penned this.yes, i think wild rocket will wow you too!"
Asian Fusion,Wild Rocket,1,One of the best meals I had in Singapore. I'm not a huge fan of fusion food but felt that they created a good mix here. The char siu and rice burger stood out along w the modern take on pomelo salad. Also had a great sake selection. Worth a go.
Asian Fusion,Wild Rocket,1,A perfect dining experience. Simply perfect. The Omakase Menu is both visually stunning as well as delicious.  The service is as perfect as one can imagine. Every detail is anticipated. [Chef] Willin spent the later part of the evening with us discussing food and wine. What an amazing and talented person. His great sense of humor and keen interest in in the experience he and team provides was a memorable conclusion to the evening. Enough can not be said about how wonderful this Mount Emily restaurant. The entire experience rean well into the night and morning and plan to return again for our 5 + hour experience with our new friends at Wild Rocket.
Asian Fusion,Wild Rocket,-1,"Hate giving this low of a review to any place but this is one of the few times I've walked out of a restaurant quite disappointed by the awful flavors of every dish we received. Everything is subjective and all restaurants have bad days which is fine but I just can't justify going back to a place like this after the experience we had.The restaurant is out of the way inside of a budget hotel/hostel. After walking inside the hotel/hostel doors, you can make your way through the Wild Rocket entrance and into the small and intimate (and awesomely decorated) interior. Really good music playing too, we were pumped.My girlfriend and I came in for a later weekday evening dinner and ordered a la carte since none of the mains looked appealing in the four course menu (and the omakase wasn't available unless you book in advance since the head chef needs to be present to serve it).We ordered the following:1) Pomelo Salad with tiger prawns and frozen coconut dressing - Easy starter but the frozen coconut dressing (I think the waitress might have said blue cheese as well) was a bit too heavy. It was the only item that we did finish though.2) Salmon Belly Red Rice and Baby Octopus donburi - The red rice, although oily, was worth eating but the fish wasn't. It had a very fishy flavor like it wasn't cooked all the way.3) Laksa pesto linguini with king prawn - Who can resist a linguini dish that is made with ""Laksa Pesto""?? We were told that so many customers loved this dish so much that they constantly requested that the chef put it back on his menu. Unfortunately for both of us, the pasta tasted awful. It tasted like an overly peppered and dry pasta dish. Both myself and my girlfriend (born and raised Singaporean) couldn't even taste the slightest bit of laksa in the pasta. The king prawn was fantastic however. We ate that and left the entire pasta.4) Thai Basil Minced Pork Bee Tai Mak with Onsen egg - Just awful. The meat tasted like cheap ground beef that you can find in a fast food restaurant. Nothing here tasted good, we both took a bite and left the entire dish. 5) Teh Tarik panna cotta with pearls - It was a good effort but I wish they did something else instead of panna cotta. The pearls are identical to those you would find in a bubble tea (they give you four pearls) and the teh tarik tastes extremely sweet. I feel this was too easy a dessert to make without much creativity.6) Pineapple dark chocolate tart - This is pretty much what you can expect a pineapple dark chocolate tart to taste like. Nothing special at all.For a restaurant that has been around as long as this one and for the amount of patrons that have been here, I really would have thought there would have been more to it. If you want a real ""Modern"" Singaporean meal, I would highly suggest you visit Labyrinth instead."

Asian Fusion,Wild Rocket,1,Very nice lunch at the chef's table! He is very friendly and open minted. Had a nice chat and the menu he served was delicious! Will be back next time I'm visiting Singapore!
Asian Fusion,Wild Rocket,1,"This is a review of a Thursday evening dinner date at Wild Rocket.The restaurant is located in the Hangout at Mount Emily.  Even though it is not, it has the feel of being in a secluded area.i quite liked the ambiance of the restaurant.  It had the feel of casual fine dining.  I thought it was a very comfortable room.  The wall with many candles added a warmth to the room.   My dinner companion  was less taken with  the space.tinyurl.com/bs5os3xThe service was very good.  Our server was attentive, professional, and polite.  He was also quite knowledgeable about the menu and proactively provided input without being intrusive. The  food ranged from good with some technical errors to extremely good.  Each dish was presented with a clean and classic style.  While simple, the presentation was elegant.Complimentary Bread - The meal began with a nice warm focaccia bread served with olive oil and salt.  When we had finished the first plate, they were quick to ask and bring another  plate.tinyurl.com/ca529xtSoft shell chili crab with squid ink mantou - This was a tasty appetizer sized interpretation of the classic chili crab.tinyurl.com/cogpfrcBeef Carpaccio with sesame ginger puree - For me, this was a home-run.  The dish came with the ginger puree in the middle.  Our server explained that  the puree should be spread out across the carpaccio.  This was slightly easier said than done.  But, once I had achieved getting it spread around, it was so good.  The spread added such a refreshing element to the simple application of beef carpaccio.tinyurl.com/d5b5t9rLaksa Pesto Linguini - My friend ordered the laksa pasta.  The flavour was quite nice.  It was a very assertive flavour but I liked it and she seemed to also.  The server had also provided input that the dish was strongly flavoured.  However, the dish (specifically the pasta) was very dry and this definitely detracted from this entree.tinyurl.com/ck2nk4zRoasted Chilean Seabass with chai poh confit & congee - The fish was perfectly prepared.  It was delicate and flaky.  However, I would have preferred that it was served with something  that would provide a balance to the overall flavours.  The congee did not seem to compliment the seabass.  It competed and came close to overpowering the simple natural flavour of the fish.tinyurl.com/cnbtceuCrab Meat Whipped Potatoes - She ordered a side of crab-meat mashed potatoes.  For each of us, this was a new preparation.  In the end, I found it to be good but it didn't really standout from other whipped potatoes and the crab may have actually interfered with creating the best possible texture for the potatoes.tinyurl.com/c9geazkDark Lava Chocolate Gateau with flambé banana - For dessert, she ordered the chocolate lava cake.  This was pretty much a standard implementation of this dish that has recently become a staple. It was good but there wasn't anything to set it apart from other versions of the  same dish.  On the other-hand, you really can't go wrong with a cake filled with delicious melted chocolate.tinyurl.com/bn5nzjxWild Rocket Strawberry Cheesecake -  Maybe it is becoming a cliché to serve food in a martini glass.  But this was still a visually interesting and appealing dessert.  Following the server's instructions, I cut my spoon down and into the dessert insuring to get a little bit of everything.  I have to say, it was divine.  It was a great dessert incorporating multiple levels of sharp flavours, sweet flavours, and varying textures.tinyurl.com/cwexnmsReceipt ($292.40):tinyurl.com/bt9bz9cOverall - I thought Wild Rocket combined excellent service, a comfortable and slightly elegant space with relatively good food that included some true high-points.  From a culinary perspective, the execution was not perfect but did not greatly affect the  overall enjoyment of the meal.  I would definitely consider returning to Wild Rocket."
Asian Fusion,Wild Rocket,-1,"Such a lovely cosy space. Warm wood and soft lighting, very inviting though the air con was set far too low. Great sake selection and reasonably priced wine list (yes, I mean, for Singapore). The menu reads so well and the staff were informed and able to describe and discuss dishes. The food I'm about 50/50. My girlfriend was worried she would have order envy but it turned out the other way around. Her red rice salmon and baby octopus starter was delicate, rich and delicious. My shitake consomme was deep, dark and earthy but the wonton itself was a let down. The wrapper was chewy and the filling bland. Her pasta was perfectly al dente in a deliciously dark sticky sauce. My chilli spanner crab linguini was so drenched in a quite sweet and not very chilli sauce that I didn't notice the pasta. Service was friendly and attentive."
Asian Fusion,Wild Rocket,1,"I headed down to this place quite a while ago and am very sure the menu has been revamped since then but I'm quite sure the tastes and quality will still be relevant now.I've heard a lot about the place prior to going to Wild Rocket, especially so from my friend who convinced me to make the trip down because she was so impressed by the food from an earlier visit. Situated within Mount Emily, it was a comfortable setting to have a nice weekend lunch amidst the greenery surrounding the small boutique hotel it is located at.Being a fan of brown rice, I naturally veered towards the Salmon Carpaccio Brown Rice for my starter. For those who love asiatic flavours, you'll fall in love with this dish - the melt-in-your-mouth salmon coupled with the nutty aromatic brown rice and sesame seeds, mixed with chewy bits of octopus meat. This was an amazing mix of textures and flavours which makes you well and truly appreciate the beauty of well-prepared food.I also had the Chilean Seabass with Chai Poh confit. I loved the flakiness of the plush fish meat which was done plain to accompany to richer topping. The chai poh was not overpowering salty like how typical ones can be, showing how properly done food doesn't need too much seasoning to work. All these was served on a bed of plain congee which was a throwback to childhood food and really comforting to have.I rounded off my meal with something richer, the Strawberry Cheesecake. More like a deconstructed version of the cake, you get a creamy strawberry cheese icecream with a thick body layered with chunky bits of graham base."
Asian Fusion,Wild Rocket,-1,"Getting to Wild Rocket is always an adventure - walking to the Grand Cathay and then climbing the 56 (if I'm not mistaken) steps to the top of Mount Emily, before tip-toeing down... The restaurant is nicely decorated and set in a dim, candle-lit space, and the waiters carry a chalkboard over when you sit to enthusiastically explain their special menu for the day, and the house wines... it's fun!Then the food comes - it's pricy (expect a main to be about $20-50 dollars), and tastes a little above average - the Pizza with Prosciutto and Rocket was pretty good, and the half Rosemary Chicken was just enough for one. Coming here is always fun, though the food isn't much to remark about!"
Asian Fusion,Wild Rocket,1,"You know, I visited Wild Rocket back when it was relatively fresh and a super 'hot table'. I wasn't impressed, and never went back.So when a friend said that dinner was at Wild Rocket, I was unenthused, and actually a little wary. Wild Rocket team, I apologise. You've gotten better. First off, the service was outstanding. I asked the waiter attending to our table if the once signature laksa pesto pasta was still available despite being not on the menu, and he was very candid in telling us that it's a love it or hate it dish. When we ended up passing, he brought out a  moderate sized portion anyway ""just for us to try"" (and of course didn't charge us for it). He was able to give recommendations easily, and most importantly, honestly! He told us to avoid certain dishes, and everything that he recommended was spot on.Well. We ignored him when it came to dessert and were glad we did, but more on that later.I confess to forgetting exactly what we had for starters and mains, but I do remember all of us being quite impressed, particularly with the mains. I believe my friend had the pork, and it was particularly memorable. The one let down that evening was the pasta main (not the pesto) that our other dining companion ordered. It was a bit flat, and really quite unspectacular. Desserts though, were an absolute treat. We had... hmm. A chendol I think? Of some sort, with delicious gula melaka, a ice jelly type thing, and a deconstructed apple pie I believe. Our waiter had actually recommended the molten chocolate cake over the ice jelly, but we were glad we ignored him. The other desserts were rich enough, and the ice jelly with lime granita... or was it a lemon sorbet, well with sour frozen thing proved to be an excellent contrast. We mainly ignored it though because really, once you've had a good molten chocolate cake, you've probably seen them all.So yes, I'm glad I went back to re-experience Wild Rocket. The food was creative, really quite delicious, and the service warm and accommodating. That's a winning combination."
Asian Fusion,Wild Rocket,1,"One of my fave restaurants in Singapore; partly because it's located on Mt Sophia (fond memories of high school at MGS) but mostly because it's so quiet and serene up in the exclusive and secluded neighborhood. Love the laksa pasta, their take on black pepper soft shell crab and everything they have on the brunch menu. If you're looking for a leisurely, quiet, no-fuss, no drama meal, Wild Rocket is the way to go"
Asian Fusion,Wild Rocket,1,"An interesting menu, truly fusion in nature. Local flavours applied to French style cuisine done with creativity. I have eaten here a few times and enjoyed the unique menu. Never a dull experience. The location is a bit hard to get to but worth the taxi ride or drive to Upper Willie Road."
Noodles,Xing Ji Rou Cuo Mian,1,"Ah yes. The hype and the review. Is it as good as it sounds? Let's find out :) My first time coming here and I was already hooked up for my second time and so on in the future. It is actually a very straightforward menu that anyone could have made and I believe you can find similar menu of wet bakchor mee anywhere in every corner of Singapore. And how different and stand out you will find this stall is compared to others. This stall only serves 1 menu and 1 menu only: wet bakchor mee. First time is not dinner nor lunch time so it was only 10 minutes wait. Second visit was late dinner time at around 10 pm and we got to wait for 1 hour for our orders to come. And anytime, I would wait without complaints at all :) the texture of the noodles is perfect, with the right consistency and flavor that seeps into the noodles (I always appreciate flavorful noodles be it bakchor mee or ramen, that comes not from the soup or condiments but the noodles itself). The soup is very flavorful with its hints of fresh sauteed garlic. The minced pork is very very good since it is cooked in perfection, in boiled soup itself. The porkballs are a perfection with its tenderness and juiciness. Basically it is a bowl of heaven I am eating and I have not had any better bakchor mee than this in entire singapore (I am open for suggestions, but for now, this is the best, hands down). So if you have the time, you should eat here. If you don't have the time, come before or after rush hours and you will be delighted and come back."
Noodles,Xing Ji Rou Cuo Mian,1,"It's the place you go for wet bak chor mee! Everyone else does it dry but this place has the power and authority to make it wet! It's the simple things that are the hardest to make, and honestly there are not many places that can compete with this kind of focus (only wet!) and quality. Let's start with the noodles. Noodle is springy yet not overly springy. There is a good bite-feel. Even if you do takeaways, don't worry that the noodle will become fat and soggy, the stall keeper will pack it separate with the soup. Thoughtful service. The soup is just so nice and you don't get tired of it. It's concocted in a traditional way of simply making good broth! It blends so well and so in-separately with the minced meat that were cooked with it. Meat balls are chewy and good, just tuck it in your mouth and I shouldn't have to review its meat balls to you!The last part is the chili. The part I never really cared about as I used to always eat it without the chili. But with just one time trying with the noodle, soup and chili, I feel in love with a brand new taste and a new world of this simple dish but yet so rare to find."
Noodles,Xing Ji Rou Cuo Mian,1,"If i have a Bak Chor Mee craving, this is where i would go to satisfy it. The noodles are different from the dry meepok version with pig's liver and minced meat. This is meat ball soup noodles at its most basic with only meat balls, minced meat and springy thin noodles. The minced meat is very different. It has a soft cottony texture that is slightly powdery. It simply disintegrates as you slurp it with your noodles. Definitely not the chewy minced pork at most stalls. The soup is a clear, savory pork broth which is simple but very comforting. There are several bak chor mee stalls at Bedok 85 Feng Shan Hawker centre but this is the one that you should be eating at. $2.50 for a small bowl which is alright if you have a small appetite or if you are ordering other dishes to share. A tip is to have this later at night when the soup has already absorbed the essence of the meat. Perfect supper dish."
Noodles,Xing Ji Rou Cuo Mian,1,"these two stalls of minced pork soup noodles (Xing Ji and Seng Hiang) are so similar and are even lined up next to each other.This is not the usual dry-tossed minced pork noodles in many other places, but a soup noodles that has only minced pork and pork balls. What I like most about this noodle is the chewy thin noodles, in a strong rich pork broth.We did a side by side taste test and it is very close. I have a slight preference (very slight really) for Seng Hiang's broth as it seems to be more fragrant due to the stronger garlic taste. But I will happily eat fro either stall.They send over the noodles, so you do not need to wait in line. Grab a table, place your order, and go order some yummy bbq chicken wings while you wait."
Noodles,Xing Ji Rou Cuo Mian,1,"Mention Blk 85 Bak Chor Mee and almost anyone will relate to that. Such is the stature of this iconic, yet, simple dish. It's a no frills dish with a simple line up of springy egg noodles, clear soup, meat balls, minced pork, crispy fried onions and sliced chilli.So what makes this dish so special? It really is the simplicity of it all. The wonderful balance of noodles with the soup that flavoured by the minced pork and fried onions, laced with hints of heat from the chilli.  It's the essence of Singapore hawker fare at its best."
Noodles,Xing Ji Rou Cuo Mian,1,"Oh delicious delicious!!! Let me state upfront that I'm normally a fan of dry style bak chor mee. However I'd make an exception in this case because this is so yummy! It's all in the soup. When I first tasted it, I wasn't immediately sold but as you continue eating, it really draws you in with its tastiness. Definitely worth a try."
Noodles,Xing Ji Rou Cuo Mian,1,"They say this is the best bak chor mee stall at Block 85. Well I've tried a couple and i can't honestly tell the difference. But that being said this stall is pretty darn good. Totally love the soup base with lots of minced meat. Only problem is that you'll have to wait for quite a while especially around dinner time. Minimum of 30 mins, I reckon!"
Asian Fusion,Yuan Chun Famous Lor Mee,1,"Long ago, when my mother was a little girl, she used to stay at one of the shop houses along Amoy Street. Now and again, my grandmother will buy home a pack of lor mee around the corner of their street - known as Yuan Chun Famous Lor Mee. Both my grandmother and my mom claim that the taste has not changed much since that time. In fact, my grandmother, who has difficulty walking, insisted on climbing up the stairs to the second floor of the food centre so that she can have a big bowl of the lor mee from Yuan Chun every time we pass by that area (that was before we knew there was a lift). I was introduced to it enthusiastically by my grandmother and mom when I was young and has been going down to Tanjong Pagar just to have a bowl whenever I have the time. The lor here is so good that I can finish the whole bowl, including the sauce. They also have fried ngoh hiang and fish strips - all the ingredients that a traditional bowl of lor mee should have.Try to go earlier (before 11.30am) on weekdays as office folks working in Tanjong Pagar area starts pouring out for lunch and the queue can be very long, although it moves really quickly."
Asian Fusion,Yuan Chun Famous Lor Mee,1,"The stall is located at the second floor of the hawker centre and has been around for a long time, occupying 2 stall spaces. Currently it is closed on thursday and friday. The minimum order starts from $4. Here it is self service style. One has to order and collect at the stall. I had been eating at the stall since I was young. I felt that the serving was getting smaller while price had increased too. The amount of fish meat in the serving had reduced a lot. It used to be chunky fish overflowing. I like that the yellow noodle did not have the ""Kee"" taste. The dish still tasted not bad.Best come during holiday when there is no office crowd. There will be no queue."
Asian Fusion,Yuan Chun Famous Lor Mee,1,"These guys deserve their reputation and the long queue. Instead of a starchy sauce you get a bowl packed with flavour - just the right balance of vinegar, chili and a generous serving of ingredients. All for the very reasonable price of $3 (regular) or $4 (large)."
Asian Fusion,Yuan Chun Famous Lor Mee,1,"Let's get this out of the way: This is the best Lor Mee I have come across. The gravy is completely unique compared with what other Lor Mee stalls offer. Far more savoury and less starchy than its competitors', it is genuinely addictive, and I make sure to patronise this stall at least once every fortnight. Besides the thick broad noodles bathed in their signature gravy, you also get pieces of pork belly, fish, and fried prawn cakes. For all these you pay $2.50 (it used to be $2), talk about affordability!There's almost always a queue (because it really is that good), but no worries, the folks are very adept at whipping up bowl after bowl very quickly. Be sure to ask for extra vinegar and crushed garlic. Also, the stall is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays."
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,Xiao Long Bao in my opinion better than Din Tai Fung and cheaper. 10 for $5.50. The xlb are tasty and soupy. Made fresh in front of you and served steaming hot :) I appreciate the simplicity of the ingredients yet the complexity of the flavors. Such a simple dish but so tasty. I'll definitely be back. Others were also ordering the Szechuan dumplings or wonton which looked really good too.
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,-1,"Food: 2.5/5.0Service: 2.0/5.0Value: 3.0/5.0Decor: 1.5/5.0Overall: 2.5/5.0Everyone wants to be a hipster, and that means taking really mediocre food in dingy stalls and talking it up like it's some gift from above.  Lets get real, these are at best decent XLB for a hawker stall, but even trying to compare these to DTF is absolute fake news.  The non-XLB items are completely mediocre (read: ugh).  Pass."
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"In terms of hawker xlb this would be one of the good ones. I still think the soup should be more oily and sticky. The skin is correct. I suppose so far din tai fung will be the most authentic although a bit "" too clean"" in flavor. For the price I think you get your money's worth. 6 for 10."
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"The only place I've ever tried XLB was at Din Tai Fung in Seattle. Even though others love it, I never thought it was that good and just assumed XLB was supposed to be that way. My views on XLB changed after going to Zhong Guo La Mian. For about $4.50 USD you get 10 amazingly juicy and perfectly steamed XLB that packs so much amazing flavor that you'll crave for months. If I can find a way back to Singapore, this spot is a must stop."
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"All-in-all, Din Tai Fung still wins in my opinion, as I prefer the flavor of the DTF xiao long bao filling. The skin here was somewhat inconsistent, and if you weren't very delicate and careful, it would break, letting the soup leak out. Everything is clearly handmade fresh here though; you can see them hard at work in the hawker stall kitchen, making each dumpling one by one and steaming the baskets. Of course these are not as aesthetically pleasing as DTF, but if you're looking for soupy dumplings at an affordable price then this is the place for you.We also ordered one bowl of beef noodle soup, one plate of pan-fried dumpling, one plate of boiled dumplings, and one plate of szechuan spicy wonton. For a group of six, the total was just S$7pp! The beef noodle soup was very delicious, and I'd definitely order that on its own again. The pan-fried and boiled dumplings were excellent as well. The pan-fried is probably more unique and requires more effort to cook (also more unhealthy). The szechuan wonton is a unique flavor of vinegar and spicy oil, and it's not for everyone. It might be an acquired taste, but none of us foreigners were really a big fan of the szechuan spiciness with vinegar."
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,Best XLB in #Singapore is found at Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao in Chinatown. #1 the steamed mini buns... basically pork dumplings but the fat from pork melts out of the meat into the bun and is kinda soupy in the buns... OH MY GOD! So good!!!!!!! #illeatforyou #XLB
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"Wildly delicious and exceptionally convenient - XLBs will be the end of me.  I will move into the Chinatown Complex and find refuge with Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao.  There is something uniquely satisfying about eating dumplings prepared before your eyes.  It's nostalgic....a taste of innocence.  One bite and they'll have you.  They'll  own your time and your wallet.    While I am reluctant to admit this kind of uncouth behavior, I can devour 30 dumplings in one sitting!  ;-)"
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"This place does different types of dumplings and some noodles as well. I sampled the dumplings and they are pretty decent, not that they are amazing in any way but the pan-fried dumplings are good and 10 for 5.5 SGD is a good deal.The line was not long when I was there but there was a constant flow of people going here and for the price it would be a place I could consider returning to."
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"Kreta Ayer market is just a labyrinth on the second floor, chocked full of food gems to be discovered. One such example, Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao.As in the namesake, you should get an order of the xiao long baos. At 10 for $5, they're a good deal, and while a little less refined than the ones from Din Tai Fung, these feel more homely and very satisfying. The soup dumplings are really juicy and the broth has good flavor. They often make the dumplings to order so there might a be a little wait as they prepare the dumplings and place them right into the steamer. It's totally worth it though."
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,-1,"Ya, if they were open.... so disappointing that I had to settle for Hawker Chan but it should be a good alternative.... yelp didn't show that this is closed though.....hope to try it again soon but for now is 1 star..."
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"It's not bad. But I dont think it's gonna win any awards soon. I ordered the szechuan spicy noodles and pan fried dumplings.You cant order half portion for the dumplings. So it's all or nothing. The dumplings are good, but I've had better. But for hawker centre standards.. 7/10.The noodles has a peanut sauce base, but it was lacking in dimensions. About 6/10 not a big fan, but it was decent.I was just too lazy to queue for the other award winning stalls.... I'll come back to try their xiao long bao next time"
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"Good, solid xlb that can satisfy any craving with the additional delight of having paid just $5.50 for 10 dumplings!! Found this on Yelp and no regrets about trying it. I'm a huge xlb fan - used to go to the crystal jade steamboat and xlb buffet for both the steamboat AND the free flow xlb! & I've just returned from Taipei where I tried the original Din Tai Fung. My conclusion: this is comparable with DTF quality xlb in Singapore, for a better price point. The skin is paper-thin without being overly soft or breakable, and the soup folded inside the dumplings is tasty and steaming hot. We thought that the filling is more generous than DTF or other places in general (and the dumpling are similar sized), and similar-tasting. The dumplings are also made-to-order, which means you have to line up for a longer time as you wait for it to steam (or pan fry if you order guo tie) but so very worth it. Obviously it's in a hawker center so the atmosphere is nothing special to speak of, but it's great for a no-frills meal. It makes me sad to think that something so simple and so good and so cheap can't be found easily in the US :( P.S I gotta try this Good Beer Company everyone's mentioning :p P.P.S. The store is #02-135 for those struggling to find it as I did: it's near the edge of the complex! And across from Hong Kong Soy Sauce Chicken store of Michelin fame."
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"I have eaten at this establishment a few times now and usually I just walk up to the counter and order a batch of freshly made xiao long baos, but today was a good 10 minutes wait. Not that I'm complaining, it was totally worth it! The wait actually allowed me to watch how the guy makes his tasty little packets of love. So I'm not a big fan of xlb that are very soupy - I know, I know, don't lynch me! - it's just my preference (and don't get me started on those tang baos). But don't get me wrong, the meat filling isn't dry by any means. I find them to be full of balanced flavor between pork and flour skin. For a little variety try them in different combination of sauces (soy or vinegar only, and mixed) and with/without ginger. Try with ketchup ... ok, just kidding. The other nice thing is the reasonable price of $5.50/10 pieces, come on. Great taste for a great price, go give this place a try."
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"We had to come here twice because the first time, they weren't open. It was 3pm so make sure to not come then. The second time we came at 515pm and they were open for business. I ordered the XLB and spicy pork dumplings. Both were super delicious. The couple owners were so nice and helpful too. They made me feel very welcomed at their food stand."
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"$5 for 10, whether it be xiao long bao, guo tie, boiled dumplings or steamed ones.I was meeting Jireh H and Amanda L for a drink at Good Beer Company. I was early and craving dumplings, decided to walkabout to survey the offerings. Started seeing many tables had big bamboo steamers on them. Finally found the dumpling shop run by 2 cheery China guys.I started with an order of boiled dumplings. Once the others took a taste, they started really getting into it. We ended up ordering a few more lots of xiao long baos and an order of guo tie.The xiao long bao has a certain sweetness to it, I think it's Chinese wine. These and the pot stickers (guo tie) seemed to be the most popular ones when we were waiting for our orders. I prefer the xiao long bao and boiled dumplings to the pot stickers as I find the stickers a bit heavy because of the oil from frying. The dumplings are already quite resplendent with meat juices inside. People were ordering dumplings to takeaway in multiple boxes.I give 5 stars not because these are the best I've ever had but they are very yummy with a bit of a unique taste and well worth the price. There's also not much of a wait despite them being made up on the spot. You can see the guys rolling the dough and filling them while waiting..free entertainment!"
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"Best Xiao Long Bao I've ever had by a good margin. More homestyle than Din Tai Fung, the dumpling skins were slightly softer and more glutinous, and the soup was very flavorful. The pan fried dumplings and Shanghai spicy noodles were also fantastic. An excellent meal for two for $14 SGD. Pair with some Tiger beer for an over the moon street food experience. Loved it, loved it, loved it!!!!"
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,I can confirm the other reviews are accurate!  GREAT dumplings.  Cheap.  Worth a trip.
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"Simply the best XLB I've had. $6/10 now and still worth it. Their other dumplings looked great too. Grab a beer at Good Beer, for ($3.50 SGD!) and a spot overlooking the courtyard."
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"After an hour into waiting in line for one of two Michelin star food stalls, Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle, we decided to pick up some soup dumplings to tie us over. The dumplings were fresh (they actually make them in front of you), juicy and the skin wrapper was delicate and thin. These were better than any that I've had at Din Tai Fung or any other soup dumping restaurant, and it was only $6 for 10. Definitely worth checking out while you're in Chinatown."
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"I cheer for the underdogs. Well, 99% of the time...only because 1% seriously should stay that way.I typically spit at the favored ones. Well, nearly 99% of the time because they tend to get over-hyped to the point that making small mistakes become so unforgivable. After all, the endless banter causes your brain to think they are PERFECT because of how they are marketed right?This probably explains my utter distaste towards Din Tai Feng (especially the two overcrowded spots in LA that supposedly has the best dumplings in the freaking area). Don't get me wrong, they are decent. Quite good at best...but nothing mind-blowing. So when people keep saying that Din Tai Feng is the ONLY to-go spot for GOOD dumplings...bile begins to form in my mouth.Fast-forward to Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao...you'll find two very friendly and hardworking PRCs (wanted to say Chinese guys but changed it PRC to purposely address the current stereotype and say these guys are freaking AWESOME; they should be culinary ambassadors) kneading dough and forming Xiao Long Baos (hereafter, XLBs) one after the other with their magical fingers. They don't even need to boast awesomeness and screw themselves up with a swollen reputation because witnessing them furiously at work to keep up with the line is enough indication that they ARE.Now one of two main reasons for visiting Chinatown Complex (the other being the Good Beer Company) and having their XLB on several occasions after Cindy Q. introduced it to our little gathering, I can safely say that $5 for 10 XLBs that taste great and pairs well with strong beers...is ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!""/Definitely-recommendNOTE: I've had it 5 times so far (20-30 each time) and the best time is usually dinner after a long line. Why? I went at lunch and my 20 XLBs came from the chiller and the dough was a bit dry and chewy compared to the ones I've had during dinner where it goes straight to the steamer freshly made.Yelp 100: 36/100"
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"Thank you Yelp for helping me find this place, as trying to locate a stall inside the overwhelming Chinatown Complex hawker center can be a daunting task. This place does not disappoint. I had 10 steamed XLB which costed me $5.50 SGD ($3.82 USD). As I slurped each of the delicate and succulent XLBs, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the broth has a sweet umami flavor. The skin was tender but strong enough to keep all the fillings in without breaking when I picked up the XLBs with my chopsticks. Many reviewers have compared this place's dumpling to DTF - an unfair comparison given that DTF is a huge global franchise. In my opinion, this place is way better than DTF. I would not hesitate to come back again and again."
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"Yes, the xlb is really good. Nice broth and tasty. The stall is found in the southeast corner of the Chinatown Complex, which is behind the CK Dept. Store. Everything is made to order, so you do have to wait a few minutes."
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"OMG... I can't believe I found this place amongst all the food stands in Chinatown Complex! We went to Chinatown complex looking for the Good Beer Company but since it was dinner time thought it would be great to get some food too especially because we were in a gigantic food court.After walking around the food court for 10 mins, I found this little shop selling xiao long bao. The couple at the shop were hand making them as you order. They were selling them at 10 XLBs for 5.50 Singaporean dollars (incredible!) I ordered 10 to share with the hubby, we finish them in 2 mins and went back to get 20 more! They were delicious and much cheaper than restaurants like Din Tai Fung...etc.Totally recommend going there if traveling in Singapore!"
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"This is my new favorite food stall at the Chinatown Smith Street Hawker Center. Excellent dumplings! Cheap! Only $4.50 for 10. The xiao long bao are great, but you HAVE to try the potstickers. They take a little longer to fry up, but definitely worth the wait. The spicy dumplings are a close second. The hawkers are really friendly and never turn anyone away when they are trying to close. (Although once the sign goes off you'll only get xiao long bao.) I've noticed that there are a lot more fellow ang moh in the queue with me lately. Probably no coincidence that so many reviews start with ""I was going to Good Beer Company and..."""
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"$5 for 10 awesome xiao long bao!  One lunch my colleagues and I descended on the stall like a horde of locusts ordering over a 100 of the xiao long bao along with wontons, pan fried dumplings and la mian.  Every dish was tasty and consistent in quality.  While the xiao long bao may not be as thin skinned as ""the best"" restaurant dumplings, they are my favorite on this island especially given their incredible value for money."
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"Best XLBs in all of Singapore. Don't waste your money anywhere else, especially not Din Tan Fung. They go down perfectly with some Good Beer Company beer :) and for 5$ for 10, how could you go wrong? Still unbelievable how they haven't changed their prices in two years and how you still only wait 5 minutes for 40 XLBs!"
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"The xiaolong baos were better than I would have thought. The soup was sweet and delicate, and it was just pretty delicious. The boiled dumplings were pretty decent as well, with loads of chives, but not as good as the xiaolong baos. I have to try the potstickers next time! :)"
Noodles,Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,1,"Went for dinner and found this stand on the second floor of the Chinatown complex. I was on a mission to find this stall along with the Good Beer Company and it was a sucess.  I ordered 10 ""steamed mini buns"" for $5.50 and the uncle there was busy hand making them.  Mine were premade as they were not busy when I stopped by so they already had some waiting but they did taste very fresh.  I ate them both with and without the ginger vinegar dip and actually preferred them without the vinegar.  They were already very juicy!"
